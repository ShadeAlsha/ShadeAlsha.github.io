Thus, if some term $c_k = n$ is divisible by 3, then, up to it, only dividing by 2 is used to build the terms (i.e., $c_i = \\frac{1}{2}c_{i-1}$ for every $i$ such that $1 \\le i \\le k$) and, consequently, $c_0 > c_1 > \\dots > c_k = n$. But this contradicts the condition $c_0 < n$. Hence every positive multiple of 3 is pure.\n\nb) If $n$ is not divisible by 3, then $n = 3k + 1$ or $n = 6k + 2$ or $n = 6k + 5$. If $n = 3k + 1$, then taking $c_0 = 2k + 1$ gives $c_1 = 6k + 2$ and $c_2 = 3k + 1 = n$. Thereby $k > 0$ since $n > 1$, therefore $c_0 < n$. Hence none of such numbers $n$ is pure. If $n = 6k + 2$, then taking $c_0 = 2k + 1$ gives $c_1 = 6k + 2 = n$, whereby $c_0 < n$. Hence also none of such numbers $n$ is pure. Hence, among the positive integers $n > 1$ not divisible by 3, only those of the form $n = 6k + 5$ can be pure.\n\n\\textbf{Remark.} Not every integer of the form $n = 6k + 5$ is pure.

For $n = 5$ a suitable coloring is given in Fig. 20.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Estonija_2010_p22_data_944f038b5c.png)\n\nFig. 20\n\nb) Fig. 20 presents a coloring with 10 red squares. We will show that this is the least possible.\n\nNote that in the $5 \\times 5$ square there are 4 unit squares in the corners, 12 squares on the sides (not in the corners), and 9 inner squares. Each corner square is contained in exactly one, side square in two and inner square in four $2 \\times 2$ squares. All 16 colourings of $2 \\times 2$ squares contain a total of 64 unit squares of which 32 are red by symmetry. Therefore, if the $5 \\times 5$ square contains $k$ red squares, among them $a$ corner squares, $b$ side squares and $c$ inner squares, then $a + b + c = k$ and $a + 2b + 4c = 32$. The equation $a + 2b + 4c = 32$ implies $c \\le 8$. If $c = 8$, then $a = b = 0$. If $c = 7$, then the only possibility to have $k < 10$ is $b = 2$ and $a = 0$. If $c \\le 6$, then always $k = a + b + c \\ge 10$.\n\nThus it is enough to show that there are no colorings with required properties with $a = 0$ and $b \\le 2$. Indeed, in this case the $5 \\times 5$ square has at least two sides not containing any red squares. Without loss of generality, let one of them be the upper side. We saw in part a) that for $n = 5$ each coloring of $2 \\times 2$ squares must occur exactly once. Since among all 16 colorings of $2 \\times 2$ squares there are 4 such where both upper unit squares are blue, and two upper rows of the $5 \\times 5$ square contain exactly $4 \\times 2$ squares, all four such colorings must be located in the two upper rows, among these the completely blue coloring. Since the same is true for the other side which does not contain any red squares, the two sides must meet and a completely blue $2 \\times 2$ square\n\nmust be in the corner where the two sides meet. Without loss of generality, let it be the left side. Then the two squares on Fig. 21 must be red, because otherwise there would be more than one completely blue $2 \\times 2$ square. But now there are two $2 \\times 2$ squares with red square in the lower right corner and the rest of them blue. Therefore there is no coloring satisfying the conditions with $a = 0$ and $b \\le 2$ and the least number of red squares is $k = 10$.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Estonija_2010_p23_data_a1ca1d6df9.png)\n\nFig. 21",

If there were $k$ and $l$ with $i \\le k < l \\le j$ such that $a_k = a_l = 2^s$, then they must be of the form $k = 2^s u$ and $l = 2^s v$, where $u$ and $v$ are odd numbers.

As 503 is a prime, one of the numbers $x$ and $y$ must be divisible by 503. So $x^2$ or $y^2$ is divisible by $503^2$, giving that both sides of the equation are divisible by $503^2$.

Therefore $y$ is divisible by 503. Analogously, we get that if $y$ is divisible by 503, then $x$ is also divisible by 503. Consequently, both $x$ and $y$ are divisible by 503. Denote $x = 503a$, $y = 503b$. Then the equation, after dividing both sides by $503^3$, simplifyies to $4a^2 + 996ab + 4b^2 = 503a^2b^2$. Assume $a \\ge b$.

This is so, for example, for the function $f(x) = \\sin x + \\cos x$, since $f'(x) = \\cos x - \\sin x = \\cos(-x) + \\sin(-x) = f(-x)$.\n\nb) The premise about the graphs is equivalent to saying that for every real number $x$, we have $f'(x) = f(x - 1)$. Assume that we have $a > 1$ such that $\\ln a = a^{-1}$. Then, defining $f(x) = a^x$, we get $f'(x) = a^x \\ln a = a^x \\cdot a^{-1} = a^{x-1} = f(x - 1)$. It remains to make sure that such a number $a > 1$ exists. Since $\\ln 1 = 0 < 1 = 1^{-1}$ and $\\ln e = 1 > e^{-1}$, the graphs of the continuous functions $g(x) = \\ln x$ and $h(x) = x^{-1}$ intersect at some point $a > 1$. This is the number we were looking for.\n\n*Remark.* One can prove that in part a) precisely all functions of the form $f(x) = c \\cdot (\\sin x + \\cos x)$, where $c \\neq 0$, satisfy the premises. The answers can be written in a different form, for example $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\cdot (\\sin x + \\cos x) = \\sin(x + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$.",

If $a_m$ is maximal of them, then by condition (3) $a_{m+a_m}$ must also be maximal. Let us prove that if $a_m$ is maximal of the numbers, then $a_{m+k \\cdot a_m}$ is also maximal for any $k \\ge 0$. This holds for $k=0$. If the claim holds for $k$, then $a_{m+(k+1) \\cdot a_m} = a_{m+k \\cdot a_m + a_m} = a_{m+k \\cdot a_m + a_{m+k \\cdot a_m}} = a_{m+k \\cdot a_m} = a_m$. This proves the claim. By condition (2) $a_m$ is not divisible by $n$. Since $n$ is prime, the numbers $a_m$ and $n$ are relatively prime. Hence among the numbers $m+k \\cdot a_m$, where $0 \\le k < n$, there is one in each congruence class modulo $n$. Hence all members of the sequence are maximal, i.e. they are equal.\n\nSuppose $n$ is a composite number; let $m$ be its divisor with $1 < m < n$. For any $k < m$ choose $a_k = m + k \\cdot n$ and continue the sequence with period $m$. Condition (1) holds, since $n$ is a multiple of $m$. Condition (2) holds, since all members of the sequence are congruent to $m$ modulo $n$. For the condition (3) notice that all members of the sequence are divisible by $m$. Hence $i$ and $i+a_i$ are always congruent modulo $m$, therefore $a_i = a_{i+a_i}$. At the same time not all the numbers are equal.",

Divide the units of time and space by 2; then the squares are of dimensions $2 \\times 2$, the coordinates of the midpoints of the squares are odd positive integers, and the speed of the ants is still 1.\n\nWe prove by induction that at integer time moments the coordinates of the ants are integers and the sum of the coordinates for any fixed ant has the same parity as the time moment. In addition, the ants can meet only at integer time moments. At time $t=0$ all coordinates of the ants are odd, so their sum is even. Suppose that at an integer time moment $t=k$ the coordinates of the ants are integers and the sum of the coordinates for any fixed ant has the same parity as the time moment. If two of the ants were to meet each other within the next time unit, they have to move toward each other from time $t=k$, hence one of their coordinates must be the same. Since the parity of the sum of their coordinates was the same at time $t=k$, another of their coordinates had to differ by at least 2. Hence they cannot meet before time $t=k+1$. Between time moments $t=k$ and $t=k+1$ every ant has changed only one of its coordinates by 1, hence at time $t=k+1$ the parity of the sum of the coordinates is again the same as the parity of the time moment.\n\nNext we will prove by induction that for any point with integer coordinates $(x, y)$ there are no collisions at this point after the time moment $t = x + y - 2$. For $x = y = 1$ this is obviously true, since there are no collisions in the middle of the lower left square (otherwise one of the ants has to arrive to this point from the edge of the board). Let $(x, y)$ be arbitrary and suppose that the claim holds for all points with the sum of the coordinates less than $x + y$. Suppose that a collision takes place at point $(x, y)$ at time $t$. One of the participants had to arrive from a point, where one of the coordinates was smaller; w.l.o.g. we can assume that this was the $x$-coordinate. If this ant has not collided with anyone before, then $t \\le x - 1 \\le x + y - 2$. If the last collision of this ant occurred at time $t' < t$, then the coordinates of the last collision were $(x - (t - t'), y)$. By the induction assumption $t' \\le x - (t - t') + y - 2$, hence $t \\le x + y - 2$.\n\nBy symmetry the claim holds when another corner is chosen as the origin. Let the last collision of a particular ant occur at the point $(x, y)$, where the coordinates are taken with respect to the nearest corner. W.l.o.g., we can assume $x \\le y$. The time from the last collision to the falling off the edge of the ants participating in the collision is at most $2m - x$, hence the time elapsed from the start is at most $x + y - 2 + 2m - x \\le 3m - 2$. By this time all ants have fallen off the edge. With respect to the original units the maximal time is $\\frac{3}{2}m - 1$.\n\nFor any $m$ the maximal time can be achieved, if in the beginning there are 2 ants at the adjoining corners of the board moving toward each other. At the moment $t = \\frac{m-1}{2}$ the pair collides and one of the ants starts moving toward the center, falling off the board at time $t = \\frac{3}{2}m - 1$.\n\nFor part a), for each ant consider the distance to the edge in the direction of its motion. After an ant falls this distance will remain 0. Observe that as long as an ant moves without collision, this distance decreases with speed 1.\n\nConsider now the sum of all such distances. When a collision happens, the sum of the distances of the two corresponding ants is $m$, both right before and right after the collision.

Analogously, homothety of ratio $\\frac{r}{r_2}$ with center $A_2$ takes line $E_2F_2$ to line $BD$. Consequently, lines $E_1F_1$ and $E_2F_2$ are parallel to line $BD$ (Fig. 6).\n\nFurthermore, note that $|BE_1| \\cdot |BA_1| = |BP| \\cdot |BQ|$ and $|BE_2| \\cdot |BA_2| = |BP| \\cdot |BQ|$, implying $|BE_1| \\cdot |BA_1| = |BE_2| \\cdot |BA_2|$.

Analogously, the midpoint of the line segment $O_1O_2$ is also equidistant from $F_1$ and $F_2$.\n\nAs line $O_1O_2$ is perpendicular to $BD$, line $O_1O_2$ is also perpendicular to $E_1F_1$. Thus the line segment $O_1O_2$ entirely lies on the perpendicular bisector of $E_1F_1$. This means that the midpoint of line segment $O_1O_2$ is equidistant from $E_1$ and $F_1$.\n\nAltogether, we have shown that these four points lie on a circle with its center at the midpoint of the line segment $O_1O_2$.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/estonian-2012-2013_p10_data_5201471cb2.png)\n% IMAGE: ![](images/estonian-2012-2013_p10_data_291e5a177e.png)\n\n**Remark:** The chains of equations (3) and (4) hold as given in the situation depicted in Fig. 6, where $F_1$ and $O_1$ lie at the same side from line $A_1E_1$. There are other situations where $F_1$ and $O_1$ lie at different sides from $A_1E_1$ or $O_1$ lies on the line $A_1E_1$ or circle $c$ lies inside circles $c_1$ and $c_2$ (see Fig. 7).

Assume w.l.o.g. that $d \\ge a$ and $f \\ge c$. Choose a quantity $s$ such that $s \\ge \\max(a, b, c)$; by applying the transformation (1) thrice, we can obtain a hexagon with three consecutive sides having the same length:\n\n\\[\n(a, b, c, d, e, f) \\xrightarrow{(1)} (s, b, c, d', e, f) \\xrightarrow{(1)} (s, s, c, d', e', f) \\xrightarrow{(1)} (s, s, s, d', e', f').\n\\]\n\nBy the assumption made above we have $d' \\ge s$ and $f' \\ge s$.

Suppose that circles $c_1, c_2, c_3$ with radius 1 and centers $O_1, O_2, O_3$, respectively, are placed in such a way that they touch circle $c$ internally and $O_1, O_2, O_3$ are vertices of an equilateral triangle (coloured dark in Fig. 19). No new circle can be placed to the same line with two existing circles with radius 1 because the three circles would require free area with length 6 which is possible only along the diameter of circle $c$. The other ways of placement are in the middle or to the other side of the narrower area between two circles (uncoloured in Fig. 19).\n\nThe circle with radius 1 and center $O$ touches all three circles, hence the location is fixed. The circle with radius 1 and center $O_1'$ being symmetric to point $O$ w.r.t. line $O_2O_3$ touches circles $c_2$ and $c_3$ and has at least one common point also with circle $c$, as it is in one line with the circle in the middle and circle $c_1$. Hence this location is fixed, too. Note that after moving the circle $c_2$ towards point $O$ the circle will intersect the circle with center $O_1'$ (since $\\angle OO_2O_1' < 90^\\circ$) and also the circle in the middle. Thus if all circles $c_1, c_2, c_3$ are moved a bit towards point $O$, chances to add new circles disappear.\n\nConsequently, if $n \\ge 3$ then Jüri can draw the circles in such a way that new circles cannot be added in the required fashion. Show now that in the case $n \\le 2$ a new circle can always be added; it suffices to consider the case $n = 2$. Let $c_1$ and $c_2$ be the given circles with radius 1 and centers $O_1$ and $O_2$. W.l.o.g., $O_1 \\neq O$. Choose $AB$ as the diameter of $c$ which is perpendicular to $O_1O$ (Fig. 20). Consider two circles with radius 1, touching the circle $c$ at points $A$ and $B$, respectively. Circle $c_1$ does not preclude drawing either of them as it is located inside the strip with width 2 surrounding the line $O_1O$ (dark in Fig. 20), where neither of the two circles outreach. Circle $c_2$ can preclude at most one of the two circles since it cannot outreach to both sides of the strip.",

For that, note that each new digit except for the first digit is congruent to twice the previous digit modulo 10. Indeed, let $a_1, \\dots, a_{k-1}, a_k$ be the existing at some time moment digits where $a_k$ is already added by Juku.

As there are only a finite number of different digits, some digit must be added repeatedly. According to the fact just proven, all following digits are repeated as well.\n\n**Remark:** This solution can be reformulated without mentioning the fact that each new digit except for the first is congruent to twice the previous one. After noting that Juku must add some digit repeatedly, denote their position numbers in the decimal fraction by *m* and *n*. Hence the digits before the *m*th digit and the digits before the *n*th digit sum up to congruent numbers modulo 10. Adding the *m*th and the *n*th digit, respectively, to the sums maintains the congruence. This means that the next digits are also equal. Thus the digits start repeating periodically.",

By building alternately equilateral triangles and squares onto the sides of a regular 12-gon, just a regular hexagon remains (Fig. 26), whence also a regular 12-gon can be partitioned in the required way.\n\nShow now that other regular polygons cannot be partitioned into smaller regular polygons. For that, consider an arbitrary polygon that is partitioned into regular polygons. As the size of an internal angle of a regular polygon is less than $180^\\circ$ and not less than $60^\\circ$, at most two regular polygons can meet at each vertex.\n\nIf a vertex of the big $n$-gon is filled by just one smaller polygon then this piece is an $n$-gon itself. Beside it, there must be space for at least one regular polygon. No more than two regular polygons can be placed there since the sum of the internal angles of these polygons and the $n$-gon itself would exceed $180^\\circ$. Two new pieces can be placed only if all these three pieces are triangular, which gives $n=3$. It remains to study the case where there is exactly one polygon beside the $n$-gonal piece. The size of the internal angle of the $n$-gon being at most $120^\\circ$ implies $n \\le 6$. The case $n=5$ is impossible as its external angles are of size $72^\\circ$ but no regular polygon has internal angles of size strictly between $60^\\circ$ and $90^\\circ$.\n\nIf each vertex of the big $n$-gon is the meetpoint of two smaller regular polygons then one of them must be a triangle since other regular polygons have internal angles of size $90^\\circ$ or more. Beside a triangle, there is space for a triangle, a quadrilateral or a pentagon.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/estonian-2012-2013_p20_data_62e70880ca.png)\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/estonian-2012-2013_p20_data_af9b8fc336.png)\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/estonian-2012-2013_p20_data_712b3536c0.png)\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/estonian-2012-2013_p20_data_1ff71cfc8d.png)\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/estonian-2012-2013_p20_data_8fde982a1a.png)\n\nIn the first two cases, the size of the internal angles of the $n$-gon will be $120^\\circ$ and $150^\\circ$, respectively, covering the cases $n = 6$ and $n = 12$. It remains to show that the third case with a triangle and a pentagon meeting at each vertex is impossible. Indeed, the side length of the pentagon must coincide with the side length of the initial big $n$-gon, because it is impossible to place a regular polygon beside the pentagon along one side. For the same reason, another pentagon must be built to the second next side along the boundary of the initial polygon. These two pentagons meet at the third vertex of the triangle built to the side between (Fig. 27). But the ulterior angle between the sides of the pentagons at the meeting point has size $360^\\circ - 2 \\cdot 108^\\circ - 60^\\circ = 84^\\circ$, which cannot be filled with interior angles of regular polygons.",

As $7^4 = 2401 > 2013$, each summand must be $1^4 = 1$, $3^4 = 81$ or $5^4 = 625$. There can be at most 3 summands 625 since $4 \\cdot 625 > 2013$.

As this is odd, exactly $0$ or $2$ of the three summands must be even. There are $4$ even numbers in use, hence $2$ even numbers must be in some two rows and $0$ even number in the remaining one. The same holds for columns.\n\nHence the even numbers $2, 4, 6, 8$ occur in the corners of some rectangle with sides parallel to the edges of the table. By interchanging rows or columns one can move the even numbers to the corners of the whole table. There are $3$ possibilities to locate these four numbers into the corners, that can not be obtained from each other by rotations and reflections of the table (Fig. 29). The last two of them cannot occur in the magic square because the missing numbers in the first and third column would coincide. Hence only the first possibility remains.

Show in the rest that there are no other perfect tuples with length 5 or larger.\n\nFor that, let $(a^m + 1, a^{m+1} + 1, \\dots, a^n + 1)$ be an arbitrary perfect tuple with length at least 5. There must exist at least two odd exponents among $m, m+1, \\dots, n$; let $k$ and $k+2$ be the two largest odd exponents. As $a^k + 1$ and $a^{k+2} + 1$ are prime powers while having a common divisor $a+1$, these two integers must be powers of the same prime $q$. Thus the larger of them, $a^{k+2} + 1$, is divisible by the smaller one, $a^k + 1$, which shows that $a^k + 1$ divides also the difference $a^2 \\cdot (a^k + 1) - (a^{k+2} + 1) = a^2 - 1$. Hence $a^k + 1 \\le a^2 - 1$, implying $k < 2$. So $k = 1$ as $k$ is odd. By choice of $k$, the only odd exponents in our perfect tuple are 1 and 3 and the tuple is of the form $(a^0 + 1, a^1 + 1, a^2 + 1, a^3 + 1, a^4 + 1)$.\n\nAs $a+1$ and $a^3+1$ are powers of the same prime number $q$, also the ratio $\\frac{a^3+1}{a+1} = a^2-a+1$ is a power of $q$. Note that $a^2-a+1 \\ge 2a-a+1 = a+1$ by $a \\ge 2$, hence $a^2-a+1$ is divisible by $a+1$. Thus the difference $(a^2-a+1)-(a+1)(a-2) = 3$ is divisible by $a+1$. This filters out the only possibility $a=2$.",

The case $|T_1| + |T_2| + |T_3| + |T_4| \\le 19$. As $|T_5| + |T_6| + |T_7| \\ge 12$, we have $|T_5| \\ge 4$. Now $|T_4| \\le 4$ implies $|T_4| = |T_5| = 4$ and hence also $|T_6| = |T_7| = 4$. Now $|T_1| + |T_2| + |T_3| = 15$ in order to get 31 in total.\n\nSuppose that all intersections $T_i \\cap T_j$, $i, j = 1, \\dots, 7$, contain at most one girl.

W.l.o.g., we can assume that $|EB| < |BF|$ (otherwise we can switch the roles of $A$ and $C$ and the roles of $E$ and $F$). Let $\\alpha = \\angle BAD = \\angle BCD$ and $\\beta = \\angle AED$. Also let $E'$ be the point symmetrical to $E$ with respect to diagonal $BD$ (see fig. 17); then $|DE'| = |DE| = |DF|$ gives that triangle $E'DF$ is isosceles and $\\angle BFD = \\angle FE'D = \\angle AED = \\beta$. Therefore\n\n\\[\n\\angle CDF = 180^\\circ - \\angle DCF - \\angle DFC = 180^\\circ - \\alpha - (180^\\circ - \\beta) = \\beta - \\alpha.\n\\]\n\nNow\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned} 180^\\circ - \\alpha &= \\angle ADC = \\angle ADE + \\angle EDF + \\angle FDC \\\\ &= (180^\\circ - \\alpha - \\beta) + 60^\\circ + (\\beta - \\alpha) = 240^\\circ - 2\\alpha. \\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nFrom here $\\alpha = 60^\\circ$, that is the angles of the rhombus are $60^\\circ$ and $120^\\circ$.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/prob1314_p20_data_ee3bc1ede4.png \"\")\n\nSolution 2: Let the first choices of Malle be $E_1$ and $F_1$ and second ones $E_2$ and $F_2$ (see fig. 18). As $\\angle E_1DF_1 = 60^\\circ = \\angle E_2DF_2$ and $|DE_1| = |DF_1|$ and $|DE_2| = |DF_2|$, the rotation of the plane by $60^\\circ$ around point $D$ that takes $E_1$ to $F_1$ must also take $E_2$ to $F_2$. The same rotation must then take the line $E_1E_2$ to $F_1F_2$ or line $AB$ to line $BC$. Therefore $\\angle ABC = 120^\\circ$, thus the angles of the rhombus are $60^\\circ$ and $120^\\circ$.\n\nRemark: In a rhombus with angles $60^\\circ$ and $120^\\circ$ there are actually infinitely many possibilities to draw an equilateral triangle with one vertex in the vertex of the rhombus and the other two on the sides.",

Thus $y = -x + 2k\\pi$ or $y = \\pi + x + 2k\\pi = x + (2k + 1)\\pi$. In the second case we get that $|y - x| = |(2k + 1)\\pi| \\ge \\pi$, but from the first equality $|y - x| = |\\sin x| \\le 1 < \\pi$, a contradiction. Therefore $y = -x + 2k\\pi$, where $k$ is an integer. By plugging this into the first equation we get $2x + \\sin x = 2k\\pi$ after simplifying. We see that this is satisfied in case of any integer $k$ by the value $x = k\\pi$; then also $y = -k\\pi + 2k\\pi = k\\pi$. As $f(x) = 2x + \\sin x$ is an increasing function, there cannot be any other solutions to $2x + \\sin x = 2k\\pi$.\n\nSolution 2: Function $f(z) = z + \\sin z$ is strictly increasing, because its derivative $f'(z) = 1 + \\cos z$ is positive everywhere, except for some isolated points. Therefore if $x < y$ in case of some solution $(x, y)$ to the system of equations, then $y = x + \\sin x < y + \\sin y = x$, a contradiction. Analogously $y < x$ gives a contradiction. In conclusion $x = y$ is the only option. By substituting it in we get $\\sin x = \\sin y = 0$, from where $x = y = k\\pi$ for any integer $k$. All pairs $(k\\pi, k\\pi)$ indeed satisfy the given system of equations.",

For improving of relationships between countries, all possible working groups consisting of exactly one government member from each country, at least $n$ among whom are women, are formed (where $n$ is a fixed non-negative integer). The same person may belong to many working groups. Find all possibilities how many countries can be in Wonderland, given that the number of all working groups is prime."
