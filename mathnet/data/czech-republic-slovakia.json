Obviously $BDIF$ is a deltoid, so $Q$ is the foot of a perpendicular from point $D$ to $BI$. Thus, applying the first Euclidean's theorem to triangle $\\triangle IBD$, we have $|IQ| \\cdot |IB| = |ID|^2 = r^2$. Similarly $|IR| \\cdot |IC| = r^2$. Thus $|IQ| \\cdot |IB| = |IR| \\cdot |IC|$, so the points $B, C, R, Q$ lie on a circle which we denote $\\gamma_a$.\n\nThe points $Q \\in IB$ and $R \\in IC$, so that point $I$ lies outside the circle $\\gamma_a$. By the above relations, we obtain that the power of the point $I$ to the circle $\\gamma_a$ is $r^2$, which means that the circles $k$ and $\\gamma_a$ are orthogonal. From the uniqueness of $k_a$ it follows that $k_a = \\gamma_a$. Thus $k_a$ contains $Q$ and $R$. Similarly $k_b$ contains $P$ and $R$ and $k_c$ contains $P$ and $Q$. Hence, $A' = P$, $B' = Q$ and $C' = R$. Therefore the radius of the circumcircle of $\\triangle A'B'C'$ is half the radius of $k$. \\u25a1",

Therefore $E = K$ and $F = H$.\n\nSince $F$ is now known to be an excenter, we have that $FC$ is the external angle bisector of $\\angle DCA = \\angle GCA$. Therefore\n\n$$\n\\angle GAF = \\angle GCF = 90^\\circ - \\frac{1}{2}\\angle GCA = 90^\\circ - \\frac{1}{2}\\angle GFA\n$$\n\nWe conclude that the triangle $\\triangle GAF$ is isosceles with $FA = FG$, as desired. $\\square$\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/CzsMT00_sol_p6_data_9aa46467bf.png)\n% IMAGE: ![](images/CzsMT00_sol_p6_data_40ea444540.png)\n\n**Comment.** This problem was proposed USAMO 1999, problem 4.",

We now define a coloring of an integer lattice $g : \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\{R, G, B, Y\\}$ by the rule $g(i, j) = f(xi+yj)$. It follows that every unit square in $g$ must have its vertices colored by four different colors. If there is a row or column with period 2, then applying the condition to adjacent unit squares, we get (by induction) that all rows or columns, respectively, have period 2.\n\nOn the other hand, taking a row to be not of period 2, i.e., containing a sequence of three distinct colors, for example *GRY*, we get that the next row must contain in these columns *YBG*, and the following *GRY*, and so on. It would follow that a column in this case must have period 2. A similar conclusion holds if we start with an aperiodic column. Hence either all rows or all columns must have period 2.\n\nLet us assume WLOG that all rows have a period of 2.

Then, the numbers $pq$ and $p+q$ are relatively prime: the product $pq$ is divisible by two primes only (namely $p$ and $q$), while the sum $p+q$ is divisible by neither of these primes.\n\nWe will look for a positive integer $r$ which can be a common divisor of both $a+1$ and $a^2+1$. If $r \\mid a+1$ and, at the same time, $r \\mid a^2+1$, then $r \\mid (a+1)(a-1)$ and also $r \\mid (a^2+1) - (a^2-1) = 2$, so $r$ can only be one of the numbers $1$ and $2$. Thus the fraction $\\frac{a^2+1}{a+1}$ either is in lowest terms, or will be in lowest terms when reduced by two, depending on whether the integer $a$ is even, or odd.\n\nIf $a$ is even, we must have\n\n\\[\npq = a^2 + 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad p+q = a+1.\n\\]\n\nThe numbers $p, q$ are thus the roots of the quadratic equation $x^2-(a+1)x+a^2+1 = 0$, whose discriminant\n\n\\[\n(a+1)^2 - 4(a^2+1) = -3a^2 + 2a - 3 = -2a^2 - (a-1)^2 - 2\n\\]\n\nis apparently negative, so the equation has no solution in the real numbers.\n\nIf $a$ is odd, we must have (taking into account the reduction by two)\n\n\\[\n2pq = a^2 + 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2(p+q) = a+1.\n\\]\n\nThe numbers $p, q$ are thus the roots of the quadratic equation $2x^2-(a+1)x+a^2+1 = 0$, whose discriminant is negative as well.\n\nTherefore, there is no pair of distinct primes $p, q$ satisfying the conditions. It remains to analyze the case of $p = q$. Then,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{p \\cdot q}{p+q} = \\frac{p \\cdot p}{p+p} = \\frac{p}{2}\n\\]\n\nso we must have\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{2(a^2 + 1)}{a + 1} = 2a - 2 + \\frac{4}{a + 1};\n\\]\n\nthis is an integer if and only if $a+1\\mid 4$, i. e. $a \\in \\{1,3\\}$, so $p=2$ or $p=5$.\n\nTo summarize, there are exactly two pairs of primes satisfying the conditions, namely $p=q=2$ and $p=q=5$.",

Notice how a satisfactory (n + 1)-digit integer can be constructed from a satisfactory n-digit integer. If the last digit of the integer is 1, we can append any of the digits 3, 4, 5. If the last digit is 2, we can append 4 or 5; if it is 3, 1 or 5 can be appended; if it is 4, 1 or 2 can be appended; and, finally, in the case of 5, we can append any of the digits 1, 2, 3.

Hence M lies in the exterior of the circle ABC (as AB is its chord) and the power of M with respect to ABC is the same m = |MA|\\cdot|MB|. Since m = |MI|^2 < |MC|^2 from the right-angled triangle CMI, it holds that |MA|\\cdot|MB| < |MC|^2. This means that the circle ABC intersects the segment MC in an interior point N, because |MN|\\cdot|MC| = |MA|\\cdot|MB| implies that |MN| < |MC| for the second point N of intersection of the ray MC with ABC. This proves the first conclusion of the problem.\n\nTo show that CNI is a right angle, we use the proved equality |MC|\\cdot|MN| = |MI|^2 and apply a familiar theorem to the leg MI of the right-angled triangle CMI: Its altitude from the vertex I meets the hypotenuse CM in such a point X which is determined by equation |MC|\\cdot|MX| = |MI|^2. Thus we have X = N in our case and the solution is complete.",

To prove that $a_2 = 11$ by a direct drawing all possibilities is too laborious. Instead of this, we introduce new numbers $b_n$: Let each $b_n$ denote the number of all \"incomplete\" coverings of a chessboard $3 \\times (2n - 1)$ by $3n - 2$ pieces $2 \\times 1$, when a fixed corner field $1 \\times 1$ (specified in advance, say the lower right one) remains uncovered. Thanks to the axial symmetry, the numbers $b_n$ remain to be the same if the fixed uncovered corner field will be the upper right one. Moreover, it is clear that $b_1 = 1$.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/14._63_RD_CZECH_AND_SLOVAK_MATHEMATICAL_OLYMPIAD_p4_data_a171d429d0.png)\n\nFig. 2\n\nNow we are going to prove that for each $n > 1$, the following equalities hold:\n\n\\[\nb_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad a_n = a_{n-1} + 2b_n. \\quad (1)\n\\]\n\n\\textsuperscript{2} For an obvious reason, we consider a chessboard $3 \\times k$ with an even $k$ only.\n\nThe first equality in (1) follows from a partition of all (above described) \"incomplete\" coverings of a chessboard $3 \\times (2n - 1)$ into two (disjoint) classes which are formed by coverings of types A and B, respectively, see Fig. 3. Notice that the numbers of elements (i.e. coverings) in the two classes are $a_{n-1}$ and $b_{n-1}$, respectively.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/14._63_RD_CZECH_AND_SLOVAK_MATHEMATICAL_OLYMPIAD_p4_data_d7986fd189.png)\n\nFig. 3\n\nSimilarly, the second equality in (1) follows from a partition of all coverings of a chessboard $3 \\times 2n$ into three (disjoint) classes which are formed by coverings of types C, D and E respectively, see Fig. 4. It is evident that the numbers of elements in the three classes are $a_{n-1}$, $b_n$ and $b_n$, respectively.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/14._63_RD_CZECH_AND_SLOVAK_MATHEMATICAL_OLYMPIAD_p4_data_60b4fee1a4.png)\n\nFig. 4\n\nNow we are ready to compute the requested number $a_5$. Since $a_1 = 3$ and $b_1 = 1$, the proved equalities (1) successively yield\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nb_2 &= a_1 + b_1 = 4, \\quad a_2 = a_1 + 2b_2 = 11, \\quad b_3 = a_2 + b_2 = 15, \\quad a_3 = a_2 + 2b_3 = 41, \\\\\nb_4 &= a_3 + b_3 = 56, \\quad a_4 = a_3 + 2b_4 = 153, \\quad b_5 = a_4 + b_4 = 209, \\quad a_5 = a_4 + 2b_5 = 571.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\\textit{Answer.} The number of coverings of the chessboard $3 \\times 10$ equals 571.\n\n\\textit{Remark.} Let us show that the numbers $a_n$ of coverings of a chessboard $3 \\times 2n$ by pieces $2 \\times 1$ satisfy the following recurrence equation\n\n\\[\na_{n+2} = 4a_{n+1} - a_n \\quad \\text{for each } n \\ge 1. \\quad (2)\n\\]\n\n(Thus the numbers $a_n$ can be computed without using auxiliary numbers $b_n$ from the above solution.) We prove (2) by excluding the numbers from the relations (1):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{n+2} &= a_{n+1} + 2b_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + 2(a_{n+1} + b_{n+1}) \\\\\n&= 3a_{n+1} + 2b_{n+1} = 3a_{n+1} + (a_{n+1} - a_n) = 4a_{n+1} - a_n.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nFinally, let us remind a well known result: each sequence $(a_n)_{n=1}^\\infty$ of numbers satisfying (2) is of the form $a_n = C_1\\lambda_1^n + C_2\\lambda_2^n$, where $\\lambda_{1,2} = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{3}$ are the roots of the equation $\\lambda^2 = 4\\lambda - 1$ while $C_{1,2}$ are arbitrary constants. Taking in account our values $a_1 = 3$ and $a_2 = 11$, we conclude that for each $n$, the number $a_n$ of all coverings of a chessboard $3 \\times 2n$ by pieces $2 \\times 1$ is given by a direct formula\n\n\\[\na_n = \\frac{3+\\sqrt{3}}{6} \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{3})^n + \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{6} \\cdot (2-\\sqrt{3})^n.\n\\]",

If $X \\neq C$, then the segment XC is a diameter of a circle (see Fig. 5) which passes through the marked orthogonal projections $P_a$ and $P_b$ of X onto BC and CA, respectively (Thales' theorem). Since the chord $P_a P_b$ subtends inscribed angles $\\gamma$ and $180^\\circ - \\gamma$, Law of Sines implies that $|P_a P_b| = |XC| \\sin \\gamma$. Using the homothety with centre X and ratio 2, we conclude that $|X_a X_b| = 2|P_a P_b|$, and hence the equalities (1) are established for any point X.\n\nThe proved formul\\ae\\ (1) imply that our task is to find exactly such points X in the plane ABC that satisfy\n\n\\[\n2|XA| \\sin \\alpha = 2|XB| \\sin \\beta = 2|XC| \\sin \\gamma > 0\n\\]\n\n(recall that the triangle $X_a X_b X_c$ has to be equilateral). Otherwise speaking, we look for all points X whose distances to A, B and C are positive and proportional as follows:\n\n\\[\n|XA| : |XB| : |XC| = \\frac{1}{\\sin \\alpha} : \\frac{1}{\\sin \\beta} : \\frac{1}{\\sin \\gamma} = \\frac{1}{|BC|} : \\frac{1}{|AC|} : \\frac{1}{|AB|}\n\\]\n\n(we have turned from angles to sides of $\\triangle ABC$ using Law of Sines again). Such points X are determined as common points of the following three circles of Apollonius (i.e. sets of points in the plane which have a specified ratio of distances to two fixed points):\n\n\\[\nk_a : \\frac{|XB|}{|XC|} = \\frac{|AB|}{|AC|}, \\quad k_b : \\frac{|XA|}{|XC|} = \\frac{|AB|}{|BC|}, \\quad k_c : \\frac{|XA|}{|XB|} = \\frac{|AC|}{|BC|} \\quad (2)\n\\]\n\nIt is clear that any point shared by two of the circles lies on the third circle as well.\\textsuperscript{3} It follows from (2) that $A \\in k_a$, $B \\in k_b$ and $C \\in k_c$, which simplifies the construction of the three circles in practice: If the bisectors of interior angles in $\\triangle ABC$ cut its interior in segments AK, BL and CM (Fig. 6), then $K \\in k_a$, $L \\in k_b$ and $M \\in k_c$ (an immediate consequence of the well known proportions such as $|KB| : |KC| = |AB| : |AC|$). Hence the centre of $k_a$ can be constructed as the intersection point of the line BC and the perpendicular bisector of the segment AK (excluding the case $|AB| = |AC|$), when $k_a$ becomes simply the perpendicular bisector of BC). Similarly, using the perpendicular bisectors of BL and CM we get centres of $k_b$ and $k_c$, respectively.)\n\nFigure 6 illustrates the case when the circles $k_a, k_b, k_c$ meet in two distinct points and hence the given problem has two solutions marked as X and Y, with the corresponding equilateral triangles $X_a X_b X_c$ and $Y_a Y_b Y_c$, respectively.\\textsuperscript{4}\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/14._63_RD_CZECH_AND_SLOVAK_MATHEMATICAL_OLYMPIAD_p5_data_42b32e6f6a.png)\n\nDespite of the fact that the requested locus of points X is determined (by an Euclidean construction), we have to discuss how the number of solutions depends on\n\nthe choice of $\\triangle ABC$. As we know, this reduces to the question of common points of any two of the circles $k_a, k_b, k_c$. This matter becomes easier if we involve again into consideration the segments $AK, BL, CM$ from Fig. 6 which are chords of $k_a, k_b$ and $k_c$, respectively.\n\n\\textbf{Discussion.}\n\na) If the triangle $ABC$ is \\textit{equilateral}, the \"circles\" $k_a, k_b, k_c$ are in fact perpendicular bisectors of the sides of $\\triangle ABC$. Consequently, the problem has a unique solution — a point $X$ which coincides with the incentre of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nb) If the triangle $ABC$ is \\textit{isosceles} (but not equilateral), say if $|AB| \\neq |AC| = |BC|$, then the circle $k_c$ is a perpendicular bisector of the base $AB$ which meets the circle $k_a$ in two points, because $k_c$ meets the interior of the chord $AK$, and hence the both arcs $AK$ of the circle $k_a$ as well. Consequently, the problem has two solutions.\n\nc) Suppose that the triangle $ABC$ is \\textit{scalene}, with the largest side, say $AB$ (as in Fig. 6). Then the ratio $|XB|/|XC|$ for points $X \\in k_a$ is larger than 1, because of $A \\in k_a$. Hence $B$ lies in the interior $k_a$, while $C$ lies in its exterior. The last together with $A \\in k_a$ implies that $L$, an interior point of $AC$, lies in the exterior of $k_a$. Thus $k_a$ intersects the chord $BL$ of $k_b$ which means that $k_a$ and $k_b$ meet in two points. Consequently, the problem has two solutions.\n\n\\textsuperscript{3} Some of these three sets (one or three) can be straight lines instead of circles -- if the corresponding ratio equals 1. We postpone this question to the closing discussion.\n\n\\textsuperscript{4} Afterwards we prove that two solutions exist whenever the given triangle ABC is not equilateral. The fact that the last is not a trivial conclusion is supported by an observation that both solutions X and Y in Fig. 6 are situated in the exterior of the triangle ABC.",

Since the angles $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ are acute, both $2\\phi$ and $2\\psi$ are between 0\\textdegree{} and 180\\textdegree{}. Thus by a well known sine property, the equality $\\sin 2\\phi = \\sin 2\\psi$ means that either $2\\phi = 2\\psi$ or $2\\phi + 2\\psi = 180^\\circ$. In the first case (when $\\phi = \\psi$), the interior angle of $\\triangle ABC$ at the vertices A and B are equal, in the second case (when $\\phi + \\psi = 90^\\circ$) the interior angle at the vertex C is right. This completes the proof of one of the two implications stated in the problem.\n\nTo prove the second (converse) implication, let us assume that (i) $|AC| = |BC|$ or (ii) $|\\angle ACB| = 90^\\circ$.\n\n**Case (i).** It follows from $|AC| = |BC|$ that the triangles $ACM$ and $BCM$ are congruent (by SSS theorem), with right interior angles at the vertex $M$. Consequently,\n\n$$\n|\\angle ABC| + |\\angle ACM| = |\\angle MBC| + |\\angle BCM| = 180^\\circ - |\\angle BMC| = 90^\\circ.\n$$\n\n**Case (ii).** It follows from $|\\angle ACB| = 90^\\circ$ that $|MB| = |MC|$ by Thales' theorem. Thus the angles $MCB$ and $MBC$ (or $ABC$) are congruent and hence\n\n$$\n|\\angle ABC| + |\\angle ACM| = |\\angle MCB| + |\\angle ACM| = |\\angle ACB| = 90^\\circ.\n$$\n\nThe converse implication is proven.\n\n**Another solution.** Let $k$ be the circumcircle of the given triangle $ABC$. Its median $CM$ can be extended to the chord $CC'$ of the circle $k$ (Fig. 2). Since the inscribed angles $ABC'$ and $ACC'$ (or $ACM$) are congruent, the considered sum of angles $ABC$ and $ACM$ is equal to the angle $CBC'$. By Thales' theorem the last angle $CBC'$ is right if and only if the chord $CC'$ is a diameter of the circle $k$. This happens if and only if the centre $S$ of $k$ lies on the ray $CM$. For such a situation, we distinguish two cases: $S = M$ and $S \\neq M$. Note that $S = M$ holds if and only if the angle $ACB$ is right (by Thales' theorem again). Thus let us analyse the second case $S \\neq M$: The three distinct point $C, M$ and $S$ are obviously collinear if and only if the line $MS$, a perpendicular bisector of a segment $AB$, passes through the point $C$. However, the last condition is equivalent to the desired equality $|AC| = |BC|$. This completes the proof (common for the both composing implications).\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/14._63_RD_CZECH_AND_SLOVAK_MATHEMATICAL_OLYMPIAD_p7_data_959f2a8012.png)\n\nFig. 2\n\nFig. 3\n\n*Remark.* Instead of the chord $CC'$ of the circumcircle $k$, it is possible to consider the tangent line $t$ to the circle $k$ at its point $C$ (Fig. 3). Since the inscribed angle $ABC$ is always congruent to the marked angle between $AC$ and $t$, the sum of the angles $ABC$ and $ACM$ equals $90^\\circ$ if and only if the tangent $t$ is perpendicular to the ray $CM$. The last is equivalent to the condition from the above solution, namely that the ray $CM$ passes through the centre $S$ of $k$.",

We will use an obvious formula $P = P_0 - P_1 - P_2$, where $P_0$ denotes the total number of segments, while $P_1$ and $P_2$ denote the numbers of segments which lie on the lateral surface or on one of the two bases, respectively.\n\nNote that the vertices of the unit squares are situated on the surface of the cylinder in such a way that exactly $y+1$ of them lie on the same of the $x$ lateral sides and, in the same time, exactly $x$ vertices lie on the same boundary circle of the two bases. These facts lead immediately to the following formulae\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nP_0 &= \\binom{x(y+1)}{2} = \\frac{x(y+1)(xy+x-1)}{2}, \\\\\nP_1 &= x \\cdot \\binom{y+1}{2} = \\frac{x(y+1)y}{2}, \\\\\nP_2 &= 2 \\cdot \\binom{x}{2} = x(x-1).\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nConsequently,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nP &= P_0 - P_1 - P_2 = \\frac{x(y+1)(xy+x-1)}{2} - \\frac{x(y+1)y}{2} - x(x-1) \\\\\n  &= \\frac{x(x-1)(y^2+2y-1)}{2}.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn view of symmetry, the number $Q$ of internal segments for the other cylinder (with base's perimeter $y$ and lateral sides of length $x$) is given by\n\n$$\nQ = \\frac{y(y-1)(x^2 + 2x - 1)}{2}.\n$$\n\nTo decide which of the inequalities $P > Q$ or $Q > P$ holds in the case when $x > y$, we factorize the difference $P - Q$ (since $P = Q$ if $x = y$, the polynomial $P - Q$ must be divisible by $x - y$):\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n2(P - Q) &= (x^2 - x)(y^2 + 2y - 1) - (y^2 - y)(x^2 + 2x - 1) \\\\\n&= (x^2y^2 - xy^2 + 2x^2y - 2xy - x^2 + x) \\\\\n&\\quad - (x^2y^2 - x^2y + 2xy^2 - 2xy - y^2 + y) \\\\\n&= 3xy(x - y) - (x - y)(x + y) + (x - y) \\\\\n&= (x - y)(3xy - x - y + 1).\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus $x > y$ implies that $P > Q$ if we show that the same condition $x > y$ implies that $3xy - x - y + 1 > 0$.

In the case when $x > y$, the number of internal segments is larger for the cylinder with bases which perimeter has length $x$.\n\nRemark. Let us describe a shorter way of determining the number $P$. The orthogonal projection of each internal segment to the fixed base of the cylinder is one of the $\\frac{1}{2}x(x-1)$ segments connecting $x$ vertices on the boundary circle. Each of these projections is common for exactly $(y+1)^2 - 2 = y^2 + 2y - 1$ internal segments, because $y+1$ is the number of vertices on the same lateral side and all the segments connecting two distinct lateral sides are internal, with exception of the two segments lying on the bases of the cylinder.

As known for the case when $r_1/r_2 \\neq 1$, the are exactly two solutions $X = H_1$ and $X = H_2$ of the equation (3) that lie on the line $S_1S_2$ and form a diameter $H_1H_2$ of the resulting circle of Apollonius. For our situation, let us add the fact that the points $H_1$ and $H_2$ are centres of both homotheties of the initially given circles $k_1$ and $k_2$.\n\nIn the second part of our solution, we will conversely assume that $X$ is a point of the circle of Apollonius given by the equation (3) and that $X$ lies outside of the line $S_1S_2$, i.e. $X \\neq H_1$ and $X \\neq H_2$. In view of the condition that $|S_1S_2| > r_1 + r_2$, the whole circle of Apollonius (with diameter $H_1H_2$) lies in the exteriors of the circles $k_1$ and $k_2$. Indeed, the last fact follows from a known position of the homothety centres $H_1$ and $H_2$ on the line $S_1S_2$: If for example $r_1 < r_2$, then the diameter $H_1H_2$ contains the diameter of $k_1$, while the diameter of $k_2$ and the diameter $H_1H_2$ are disjoint. (See also *Remark* below.)\n\nThe proven property implies that $XS_1S_2$ is a triangle with $|XS_1| > r_1$ and $|XS_2| > r_2$. Thus there are points $Y_1 \\in k_1$ and $Y_2 \\in k_2$ lying on the segments $S_1X$ and $S_2X$, respectively. Since the equalities (2) are valid again, it is possible to transform the equation (3) to equation (1). Consequently, the triangles $XS_1S_2$ and $XY_1Y_2$ are similar (now by SAS theorem) and hence $S_1S_2 \\parallel Y_1Y_2$. Therefore the distances of $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ to the line $S_1S_2$ are equal which proves the required property of the point $X$.\n\n*Answer.* If $r_1 \\neq r_2$, the locus of points $X$ is the circle of Apollonius which is given given by the above equation (3), excepting the two points on the line $S_1S_2$. If $r_1 = r_2$, the locus is the perpendicular bisector of the segment $S_1S_2$, with exception of the midpoint of $S_1S_2$.\n\n*Remark.* Let us prove directly the needed fact that any solution (i.e. point) $X$ of the equation (3) lies in the exteriors of the circles $k_1$ and $k_2$. It follows easily from (3) that the differences $|XS_1| - r_1$ and $|XS_2| - r_2$ possess the same sign, which together with the following inequality\n\n$$\n(|XS_1| - r_1) + (|XS_2| - r_2) \\leq |S_1S_2| - (r_1 + r_2) > 0,\n$$\n\nleads to the conclusion that both the differences are positive, i.e. $|XS_1| > r_1$ and $|XS_2| > r_2$, as promised to be proven.",

The cases $y = 0$ or $z = 0$ are discussed similarly. Thus we have obtained three groups of solutions $(x, y, z)$ which are formed by triples $(t, 0, 0)$, $(0, t, 0)$ and $(0, 0, t)$ respectively, where $t$ is any real number. Moreover, we have observed that all the other solutions satisfy the condition $xyz \\neq 0$, which is supposed to hold in what follows.\n\nFactorizing the equation $x(y^2 + 2z^2) = y(z^2 + 2x^2)$ yields $(2x - y)(z^2 - xy) = 0$. Thus we distinguish two cases (depending on the fact which of the two factors vanishes).\n\n(i) $2x - y = 0$. After setting $y = 2x$ the given system is reduced to the only equation\n\n$$\n2x(2x^2 + z^2) = 9x^2z,\n$$\n\nwhich can be simplified (by dividing $x \\neq 0$) to\n\n$$\n4x^2 + 2z^2 - 9xz = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad (x - 2z)(4x - z) = 0.\n$$\n\nThus the case (i) yields exactly two groups of solutions $(2t, 4t, t)$ and $(t, 2t, 4t)$, where $t$ is any real number.\n\n(ii) $z^2 - xy = 0$. Substituting $z^2 = xy$ into the given system, we now get the only equation\n\n$$\nxy(2x + y) = z(x^2 + 2y^2),\n$$\n\nwhich is (because of the inequality $x^2 + 2y^2 > 0$) equivalent to\n\n$$\nz = \\frac{xy(2x + y)}{x^2 + 2y^2}.\n$$\n\nAt this moment we have to find when such a $z$ obeys the condition $z^2 = xy$.

Thanks to the cyclic symmetry, the given system yields even three factorized equations\n\n$$\n(2x - y)(z^2 - xy) = 0, \\quad (2y - z)(x^2 - yz) = 0, \\quad (2z - x)(y^2 - zx) = 0. \\quad (1)\n$$\n\nThe case $2x - y = 0$ were discussed as (i) in the above solution, the cases $2y - z = 0$ and $2z - x$ can be treated analogously. Summarizing the three cases, we get all the solutions indicated in *Answer*, excepting the triples $(t, t, t)$. Thus for the remaining case when\n\n$$\nz^2 - xy = x^2 - yz = y^2 - zx = 0 \\quad (2)\n$$\n\nour task is to show that the only satisfactory triples are $(x, y, z) = (t, t, t)$. However, the last conclusion is an easy consequence of the dentity\n\n$$\n(x - y)^2 + (y - z)^2 + (z - x)^2 = 2(z^2 - xy) + 2(x^2 - yz) + 2(y^2 - zx),\n$$\n\nwhose right-hand side vanishes by (2), and hence all the squares in the left-hand side vanish as well, which completes the proof. Let us add a note that the system (2) can be solved in another way: The equations in (2) easily imply that the values of $x^3$, $y^3$, $z^3$ are the same (namely, equal to the value of $xyz$), which happens only if $x = y = z$ by the footnote on previous page.\n\n**Another solution.** To avoid unnecessary repetition from the above solution, we will solve the problem under the condition that $xyz \\neq 0$.\n\nDividing both sides of the given equations by $xyz$ we obtain\n\n$$\n\\frac{y}{z} + \\frac{2z}{y} = \\frac{z}{x} + \\frac{2x}{z} = \\frac{x}{y} + \\frac{2y}{x}, \\quad (3)\n$$\n\nwhich can be read as a coincidence of values of a function $f(s) = s + 2/s$ in three nonzero points $s_1 = y/z$, $s_2 = z/x$ a $s_3 = x/y$. Thus we first find when $f(s) = f(t)$ for two nonzero real numbers $s$ and $t$. It follows from the identity\n\n$$\nf(s) - f(t) = s + \\frac{2}{s} - t - \\frac{2}{t} = \\frac{(s-t)(st-2)}{st}\n$$\n\nthat $f(s) = f(t)$ if and only if $s = t$ or $st = 2$. Consequently, the system (3) holds if and only if the introduced numbers $s_1, s_2, s_3$ possess the following property: $s_i = s_j$ or $s_i s_j = 2$, for any indices $i$ and $j$. However, if there exists a permutation $(i, j, k)$ of $(1, 2, 3)$ such that $s_i s_j = 2$, then the identity $s_i s_j s_k = 1$ implies that $s_k = \\frac{1}{2}$ and hence $s_i \\in \\{\\frac{1}{2}, 4\\}$ (because $s_i = s_k$ or $s_i s_k = 2$). Thus the assumption $s_i s_j = 2$ leads to the conclusion that $(s_1, s_2, s_3)$ is a permutation of $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}, 4)$. It is easy to check that exactly three such permutations are satisfactory and yield the solutions $(4t, t, 2t)$, $(2t, 4t, t)$ and $(t, 2t, 4t)$ of the given system. In the remaining case when $s_1 = s_2 = s_3$, the identity $s_1 s_2 s_3 = 1$ implies that $s_i = 1$ for each $i$, which yields the solutions $(t, t, t)$.",

Denoting first the teams by numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (in a fixed way), we rearrange the five rounds of any satisfactory draw by means of the following numbering: Let 1 and 2 be the rounds with matches of the pairs of teams (1, 2) and (1, 3), respectively. If a pair (3, a) plays in the round 1 and if a pair (2, b) plays in the round 2, then a, b are two distinct numbers from $\\{4, 5, 6\\}$ (otherwise the third pairs in the rounds 1 and 2 are identical). Let 3, 4 and 5 denote the rounds with pairs (1, a), (1, b) and (1, c) respectively, where $c \\in \\{4, 5, 6\\} \\setminus \\{a, b\\}$. Up to this moment, we have fixed an uncompleted draw\n\n1: (1, 2), (3, a),\n2: (1, 3), (2, b),\n3: (1, a),\n4: (1, b),\n5: (1, c),\n\nwhich can be extended to a the complete draw in the only one way:\n\n1: (1, 2), (3, a), (b, c),\n2: (1, 3), (2, b), (a, c),\n3: (1, a), (2, c), (3, b),\n4: (1, b), (2, a), (3, c),\n5: (1, c), (2, 3), (a, b).\n\nSince $(a, b, c)$ is any permutation of $(4, 5, 6)$, the total number of the complete draws (written as above) is $3! = 6$. Taking in account the number 5! of the possible permutations of the five rounds and the number 3! of possible permutations of the three courts, we conclude that the requested number of all draws is equal to\n\n$$\n6 \\cdot 5! \\cdot 6^5 = 5! \\cdot 6^6 = 2^9 \\cdot 3^7 \\cdot 5 = 5598720.\n$$\n\n**Another solution.** Let us denote the six teams by numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and construct first an \"unordered\" draw in which the rounds will be \"numbered\" by the opponents of the team 1 — see the following table in which the other opponents of the team 2 are denoted as a, b, c, d:\n\n1: (1, 2),\n2: (1, 3), (2, a),\n3: (1, 4), (2, b),\n4: (1, 5), (2, c),\n5: (1, 6), (2, d).\n\nNote that $(a, b, c, d)$ is a permutation of the quadruple $(3, 4, 5, 6)$ and that the following two restrictions are evident:\n\n$$\n\\triangleright 3 \\neq a, 4 \\neq b, 5 \\neq c \\text{ and } 6 \\neq d\n$$\n\nThe two-element sets $\\{3, a\\}$, $\\{4, b\\}$, $\\{5, c\\}$, $\\{6, d\\}$ are pairwise distinct.\n\nIt is clear that under these two conditions, the third pairs for the rounds 2-5 are uniquely determined, as well as the remaining two pairs for the round 1. Consequently, we have to calculate the number of permutations $(a, b, c, d)$ of the quadruple (3, 4, 5, 6) which satisfy the two above stated conditions.\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle we conclude that the first condition is fulfilled by exactly nine permutations:\n\n$$\n4! - \\left( 4 \\cdot 3! - \\binom{4}{2} \\cdot 2! + 4 - 1 \\right) = 9.\n$$\n\nMoreover, exactly three of them do not satisfy the second condition, namely the permutations $(4, 3, 6, 5)$, $(5, 6, 3, 4)$ and $(6, 5, 4, 3)$. Thus the total number of the satisfactory permutations equals $9 - 3 = 6$.\n\nWe have proved that there are six \"unordered\" draws in the above specified sense. Combining this result with the idea of permuting the rounds and the courts, we conclude that the requested number of the draws is equal to\n\n$$\n6 \\cdot 6^5 \\cdot 5! = 5! \\cdot 6^6 = 2^9 \\cdot 3^7 \\cdot 5 = 5,598,720.\n$$\n\n**Remark.** All the six satisfactory permutations $(a, b, c, d)$ from the preceding solutions are $(4, 5, 6, 3)$, $(4, 6, 3, 5)$, $(5, 3, 6, 4)$, $(5, 6, 4, 3)$, $(6, 3, 4, 5)$, $(6, 5, 3, 4)$. It is possible to find them by an easy systematic examination (and thus to avoid the above presented calculation based on the inclusion-exclusion principle). On the other hand, the number 3 of the permutations $(a, b, c, d)$ that satisfy the first, but not the second condition, can be determined as the number of the \"faulty\" equalities\n\n$$\n\\{3, a\\} = \\{4, b\\}, \\{3, a\\} = \\{5, c\\}, \\{3, a\\} = \\{6, d\\},\n$$\n\nwhich are successively equivalent to the others:\n\n$$\n\\{5, c\\} = \\{6, d\\}, \\{4, b\\} = \\{6, d\\}, \\{4, b\\} = \\{5, c\\}.\n$$",

Since all the $d_i$'s are odd too, it follows from $11d_5+8d_7 = 3n$ that $d_7 | 11d_5$ as well as $d_5 | 8d_7$, hence $d_5 | d_7$. In view of $d_7 > d_5$, the relations $d_5 | d_7 | 11d_5$ imply that $d_7 = 11d_5$. Substituting this into $11d_5 + 8d_7 = 3n$, we obtain $99d_5 = 3n$ or $33d_5 = n$. Thus the four numbers 1, 3, 11 and 33 are divisors of $n$, more exactly all its divisors smaller that 50, since the fifth divisor $d_5$ satisfies $d_5 = d_3 + 50 > 50$. Consequently, it holds that $d_1 = 1$, $d_2 = 3$, $d_3 = 11$, $d_4 = 33$, $d_5 = d_3 + 50 = 61$, and thus $n = 33d_5 = 33 \\cdot 61 = 2013$.

Substituting this into $11d_5 + 8d_7 = 3n$, we obtain (after cancelling $n$) an equation $11/x + 8/y = 3$ which can be solved in a standard way, for example by a simple factorization:\n\n$$\n8x = y(3x - 11) \\Leftrightarrow 8(3x - 11) + 88 = 3y(3x - 11) \\Leftrightarrow (3x - 11)(3y - 8) = 88.\n$$\n\nThe first equation implies that $3x - 11 > 0$ and hence $3y - 8 > 0$ as well. Note that $x \\ge y + 1$ yields $3x - 11 \\ge 3y - 8 > 0$.

Due to the presumed similarity, the angles XAZ and BYX are congruent (Fig. 1) and hence $|\\angle BAZ| = |\\angle BY'Z|$ as well. Using the well known inscribed angles property we conclude that the circumcircle of $\\triangle ABZ$ passes not only through the point Y, but also through the point $Y'$. The line AB (as a perpendicular bisector of the chord YY') passes through the centre O of the circle k and thus the chord AB is a diameter of k. Since the segment AB is fixed, the circle $k = ABYZ$ is common for all satisfactory triangles XYZ and the midpoint M of YZ must lie in the interior of k. Since the both angles OMZ and OMY are right (Fig. 2), the (lesser) angles AMO and BMO are acute and thus the point M must lie in the intersection of the exteriors of Thales' circles with diameters AO and BO. In what follows we will show the both derived necessary conditions determine the locus of all the possible midpoints M.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/14._63_RD_CZECH_AND_SLOVAK_MATHEMATICAL_OLYMPIAD_p13_data_6ad0f1c566.png)\n\nFig. 1\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/14._63_RD_CZECH_AND_SLOVAK_MATHEMATICAL_OLYMPIAD_p13_data_70f743be8c.png)\n\nFig. 2\n\nSo, let M be any point in the interior of k for which the both angles AMO and BMO are acute (i.e. M lies in the exteriors of the circles with diameters AO and BO). Consider a chord of k which passes through M perpendicularly to OM. This chord does not intersect the diameter AB, because of the acute angles AMO and BMO. Thus the endpoints of the chord with the midpoint M can be denoted as Y and Z so that A, B, Y, Z lie on k in this order. If Y reflects to Y' through the diameter AB and if X denotes the intersection point of the segments AB a Y'Z, then the triangles XBY a XZA are similar as required (by theorem AA). This completes the solution.\n\n*Conclusion.* The locus under consideration is the interior of the highlighted region bounded by the three circles with diameters AB, AO and BO, where O denotes the midpoint of segment AB (Fig. 3).\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/14._63_RD_CZECH_AND_SLOVAK_MATHEMATICAL_OLYMPIAD_p13_data_a2650a523f.png)\n\nFig. 3",

Since the ordering of the numbers $x, y, z$ is irrelevant and they can not be of the same sign because of (1), we can without the loss of generality assume $x > 0, y > 0$, and $z < 0$, and find the maximum value of $V = |x + y + z|$.\n\nWe can transform (1) equivalently to\n\n\\[\nf(x) + f(y) = f(t), \\quad \\text{where} \\quad t := -z > 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f(x) = x + \\frac{1}{x},\n\\]\n\nwith $x, y, t \\in I := (1, \\infty)$. In the following, we shall use the well known fact about the function $f$: It is an increasing bijection mapping $I$ onto $(2, \\infty)$ (the trivial proof is omitted here). Applying this, from\n\n\\[\nf(t) = f(x) + f(y) = x + \\frac{1}{x} + y + \\frac{1}{y} > x + y + \\frac{1}{x+y} = f(x+y)\n\\]\n\nwe get $t > x + y$, hence $x + y + z = x + y - t < 0$. Therefore our aim is to maximize the positive expression $V = |x + y + z| = t - x - y$.\n\nWe will call valid every triple $(x, y, t) \\in I^3$ satisfying $f(x) + f(y) = f(t)$. One of the valid triples is $(1, 1, t_0)$, with $t_0 > 1$ such that $f(t_0) = 4$, i. e., $t_0 = 2 + \\sqrt{3}$. For this triple, we have $V = \\sqrt{3}$. We shall show this is the desired maximum. The proof will be based on the following lemma: Whenever $(x, y, t)$ and $(x, y', t')$ are valid triples with the same first component $x$, and $y' < y$, we have $t - x - y < t' - x - y'$. If this lemma is true, then, with respect to the symmetry, the similar conclusion holds for the valid triples $(x, y, t)$ and $(x', y, t')$ with the same second component $y$. Hence, any valid triple $(x, y, t)$ can be replaced by $(x, 1, t')$ and then by $(1, 1, t_0)$, and the value of $V$ increases or remains the same during this process, concluding $\\max V = \\sqrt{3}$. (Moreover, this also implies that $(1, 1, 2+\\sqrt{3})$ is the only valid triple for which the maximum value $V = \\sqrt{3}$ is reached.)\n\nTo prove the lemma, notice that from\n\n\\[\nf(t) = f(x) + f(y), \\quad f(t') = f(x) + f(y'),\n\\]\n\nand from $f(y') < f(y)$ (which is implied by the given assumption $y' < y$), we have $f(x) < f(t') < f(t)$, hence $1 < t' < t$. Therefore $1 < t'y' < ty$, and from\n\n\\[\nf(x) = f(t) - f(y) = (t - y) \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{ty} \\right) = f(t') - f(y') = (t' - y') \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{t'y'} \\right),\n\\]\n\nusing the estimates\n\n\\[\n0 < 1 - \\frac{1}{t'y'} < 1 - \\frac{1}{ty},\n\\]\n\nwe obtain $t - y < t' - y'$, which is equivalent to the desired $t - x - y < t' - x - y'$.

If $n > 0$, the equality can be rewritten as $a(x_{n-1} + b) \\equiv a(x_{m-1} + b) \\pmod{10\\,000}$, that is,\n\n$$\n10\\,000 \\mid a(x_{n-1} + b) - a(x_{m-1} + b) = a(x_{n-1} - x_{m-1}).\n$$\n\nSince $a$ is coprime with $10\\,000$, we have $10\\,000 \\mid x_{n-1} - x_{m-1}$, implying $x_{n-1} = x_{m-1}$. But this is in contrary with the assumption $x_n$ was the first term whose value repeats.\n\nThe previous paragraph suggests the algorithm how to display the requested number infinitely many times: We only need to produce the number once, using buttons with $a$ coprime with $10\\,000$, and then repeat the sequence $+b, \\cdot a, +b, \\cdot a, \\dots$ forever. In case we get the requested number with even number of presses, i. e., ending with addition, repeating the sequence $\\cdot a, +b, \\cdot a, +b, \\dots$ will do the same desired effect.\n\nThere are many ways how to display 2015 using only few presses. E. g., we can try to find $a, b$ such that $(1 \\cdot a + b) \\cdot a = 2015$. Since $2015 = 5 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 31$, we can take $a = 31$ and $b = 5 \\cdot 13 - a = 65 - 31 = 34$. Indeed, we will get\n\n$$\n1 \\xrightarrow{\\cdot 31} 31 \\xrightarrow{+34} 65 \\xrightarrow{\\cdot 31} 2015.\n$$\n\nNotice that 31 is coprime with $10\\,000$. Therefore the (a) part is solved.\n\nIn the part (b), we analogously wish to generate the sequence $(x_n)$ described above with $x_0 = 5813$. However, it is not so easy to produce the initial occurrence of 5813 using only a few presses. Therefore, we shall instead produce $5813 + b$, knowing that performing the sequence $\\cdot a, +b, \\cdot a, \\dots$ afterwards will eventually reach $5813$. One possible way is to find $a, b$ according to the schema\n\n$$\n1 \\xrightarrow{\\cdot b} b \\xrightarrow{+b} 2b \\xrightarrow{\\cdot a} 2ab \\xrightarrow{+a} 2ab + a = 5813 + b.\n$$\n\nThe equation can be rewritten as $(2a-1)(2b+1) = 11625 = 3 \\cdot 5^3 \\cdot 31$. From there, we can easily deduce several 2-digit solutions, one of which is $a = 47, b = 62$. Since 47 is coprime with 10000, the procedure\n\n$$\n1 \\xrightarrow{\\cdot 62} 62 \\xrightarrow{+62} 124 \\xrightarrow{\\cdot 47} 5828 \\xrightarrow{+47} 5875 \\xrightarrow{\\cdot 47} - \\xrightarrow{+62} - \\xrightarrow{\\cdot 47} - \\xrightarrow{+62} \\dots\n$$\n\nwill reach numbers ending with $5875 - 62 = 5813$ infinitely many times.\n\n*Remark.* In fact, 5813 is the only 4-digit number that need at least 7 presses under the condition at least one of the numbers on the buttons is coprime with 10000. So trying to produce it directly from 1 may be painful. On the other hand, there are many other ways how to produce it in a similar fashion as described above. Here is the sketch of another solution:\n\n$$\n1 \\xrightarrow{\\cdot 89} 89 \\xrightarrow{+89} 178 \\xrightarrow{\\cdot 89} 15842 \\xrightarrow{+60} 15902 = 15813 + 89 \\xrightarrow{\\cdot 89+89} - \\xrightarrow{\\cdot 89+89} \\dots\n$$\n\n**Second solution.** One can construct a sequence in which every 4-digit number occurs infinitely many times. Consider the calculator with $a = 11$ and $b = 12$. Applying the same arguments as above, we deduce that if we keep pressing the first button (with number 11 on it, which is coprime with 10000), after a finite even number of presses we obtain a number ending with 0001 again. If we change the button in the very last operation, that is, we replace +11 with +12, we get a number ending with 0002. In the same way, we can always increment the number formed by the last 4 digits by 1 (or change 9999 to 0000). The conclusion follows.",

Since $k$ lies in the half-plane $ACB$ and $l$ lies in the half-plane $ABC$, the point $X$ lies inside of the angle $BAC$ (Fig. 4). Using the well known fact about the angle between a tangent and a chord of a given circle we get $\\angle XAE = \\angle XBA$ and $\\angle XAB = \\angle XEA$. Therefore the triangles $ABX$ and $EAX$ are similar.\n\nDenote by $\\gamma$ the measure of $\\angle ACB$. We have $\\angle AOB = 2\\gamma$, as $\\angle AOB$ is the central angle corresponding to the inscribed angle of measure $\\gamma$ in the circumcircle of the triangle $ABC$.\n\nThe line $BH$ passes through the centre of $l$ and is perpendicular to its chord $AE$, so it is in fact the axis of symmetry of the chord $AE$. Therefore $AH = HE$, and from the isosceles triangle EAH with $AH \\perp BC$, we obtain $\\angle EAH = 90^\\circ - \\gamma$, hence $\\angle AHE = 2\\gamma$.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/SVK_Other_2015_p8_data_d3958239de.png)\n\nFig. 4\n\nThe triangles $ABO$ and $EAH$ are both isosceles, and have the vertex angle of the same measure, so they are similar. We have two pairs of similar triangles with the same ratio of similitude $AB : EA$. Since $O$ and $X$ lie on the same side of $AB$, and $H$ and $X$ lie on the same side of $EA$, the quadrilaterals$^1$ $ABXO$ and $EAXH$ are similar.\n\nConsider the rotation with centre $X$ which maps the ray $XB$ onto the ray $XA$. With respect to the derived similarity, the ray $XO$ is mapped onto the ray $XH$ under this rotation. Therefore we have\n\n$$\n\\angle HXO = \\angle AXB = 180^\\circ - \\angle BAC.\n$$\n\nThe last identity follows from the fact that $\\angle AXB$ is the inscribed angle corresponding to the chord $AB$ of $k$, while $\\angle CAB$ is the angle between this chord and its tangent, and both $X$ and $C$ lie in the same half-plane determined by this chord.\n\n*Remark.* Instead of rotation, one may consider the spiral similarity which maps $ABXO$ onto $EAXH$. Since it maps $BA$ onto $AC$, it is clear that the rotating part of this map rotates all the lines by angle $180^\\circ - \\angle BAC$.\n\n**Second solution.** (*Outline.*) It is possible to solve the problem using coordinates. Let $A$ be the origin and $B$ lies on the $x$-axis. Denote by $b$ the first coordinate of $B$ and let $(c, v)$ be the coordinates of $C$. Routine calculations give\n\n$$\nA = (0,0), \\quad B = (b,0), \\quad C = (c,v), \\quad H = \\left(c, \\frac{c(b-c)}{v}\\right), \\quad O = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}b, \\frac{c^2+v^2-bc}{2v}\\right), \\\\ S_k = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}b, -\\frac{bc}{2v}\\right), \\quad S_l = \\left(0, \\frac{bc}{v}\\right), \\quad X = \\left(\\frac{6bc^2}{9c^2+v^2}, \\frac{2bcv}{9c^2+v^2}\\right), \\quad Y = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}b, \\frac{bc}{2v}\\right).\n$$\n\nHere, $S_k$ and $S_l$ are the centres of $k$ and $l$, respectively, and $Y$ is the intersection point of the line $BH$ and the line $OS_k$ (these two lines are perpendicular to $AC$ and $AB$, respectively, hence they form the angle of the same measure as $\\angle BAC$).\n\nInstead of expressing the measure of $\\angle HXO$, we will show that $X, O, H$, and $Y$ are concyclic, that is, the determinant\n\n$$\n\\left| \\begin{array}{ccc} \\frac{(6bc^2)^2 + (2bcv)^2}{(9c^2 + v^2)^2} & \\frac{6bc^2}{9c^2 + v^2} & \\frac{2bcv}{9c^2 + v^2} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{b^2}{4} + \\frac{(c^2 + v^2 - bc)^2}{4v^2} & \\frac{b}{2} & \\frac{c^2 + v^2 - bc}{2v} & 1 \\\\ c^2 + \\frac{c^2(b-c)^2}{v^2} & c & \\frac{c(b-c)}{v} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{b^2}{4} + \\frac{b^2c^2}{4v^2} & \\frac{b}{2} & \\frac{bc}{2v} & 1 \\end{array} \\right|\n$$\n\nevaluates to zero. In fact, this is an easy exercise, provided we know basic tricks from linear algebra (adding a scalar multiple of one row to another row does not change the value of the determinant; the same is valid for columns; when checking only zero value, we can multiply any row/column by a nonzero scalar).\n\nIt remains to show that among the two possible values, $\\angle BAC$ and $180^\\circ - \\angle BAC$, of an inscribed angle corresponding to the chord $HO$ of the circumcircle of the triangle $HOY$, the latter always apply for $\\angle HXO$. Also, the case $Y = O$ or $Y = H$ should be handled separately. One may use some kind of continuity arguments to show that we cannot \"jump\" from one value to another.",

Let $a$ and $b$ be number of the objects in the rooms $A$ and $B$ before the move. This number after the move we denote by $a'$ and $b'$. By the conditions\n\n$$\na' = \\frac{n-1}{n}a, \\quad b' = b + \\frac{1}{n}a\n$$\n\nholds. From the first equation and an identity $a + b = a' + b'$ we obtain\n\n$$\na = \\frac{n}{n-1}a', \\quad b = b' - \\frac{1}{n-1}a'\n$$\n\nNow let $M$ be the final number of the objects in every room after the fourth move. By this identity we can compute the initial number of objects in every room in terms of $M$ and $n$:\n\nFinally:\n\n$M$ & $M$ & $M$ & $M$\n\nbefore $4 \\to 1$: $\\frac{n-2}{n-1}M,$ & $M,$ & $M,$ & $\\frac{n}{n-1}M;$\n\nbefore $3 \\to 4$: $\\frac{n-2}{n-1}M,$ & $M,$ & $\\frac{n}{n-1}M,$ & $M;$\n\nbefore $2 \\to 3$: $\\frac{n-2}{n-1}M,$ & $\\frac{n}{n-1}M,$ & $M,$ & $M;$\n\nbefore $1 \\to 2$: $\\frac{n(n-2)}{(n-1)^2}M,$ & $\\frac{(n-1)^2+1}{(n-1)^2}M,$ & $M,$ & $M.$\n\nSince the number of objects in the first room was positive, $n \\ge 3$ holds. Now we can easily find the minimum of\n\n$$\nV_2 = \\frac{(n-1)^2 + 1}{(n-1)^2} M.\n$$\n\nThe difference between numerator and denominator is 1, so the fraction is irreducible. Since $V_2$ is integer it must be $M = k(n-1)^2$ for proper $k$, therefore $V_2 = k((n-1)^2+1)$. For $n \\ge 3$ we can estimate $(n-1)^2 + 1 \\ge 5$, so $V_2 \\ge 5$ too. Using $n = 3, k = 1$ and $M = 4$ we obtain $V_2 = 5$ and we can easily check that the quadruple (3, 5, 4, 4) satisfies the problem: it transforms to quadruple (2, 6, 4, 4), then (2, 4, 6, 4), after that (2, 4, 4, 6) and finally (4, 4, 4, 4). So the minimal numbers of objects in the second room is 5 and we can obtain it only for $n = 3$ because for $n \\ge 4$ is $V_2 \\ge 3^2 + 1 = 10$.",

This function has obviously the following properties:\n\n- For all primes $p$ and positive integers $n$ is $v_p(n)$ non-negative integer.\n- For all positive integers $m, n$ and all primes $p$ is $v_p(mn) = v_p(m) + v_p(n)$.\n- For all primes $p$ is $v_p(p!) = v_p(p) = 1$.\n- For all primes $p$ is $v_p((p+1)!) = 1$, $v_p(p+1) = 0$.\n- For all primes $p$ and all positive integers $n < p$ is $v_p(n!) = v_p(n) = 0$.\n- Positive integer $n$ is a square if and only if $v_p(n)$ is even (including zero) for all primes $p$.\n\nLet us denote $S = n!$ the initial value of the product on the table and $S'$ its final value after adding factorials. We can easy to see from the properties of $v_p$ that for $n$ is equal to any prime $p$ we obtain $v_p(S) = v_p(p!) = 1$ and $v_p(S') = 1$, because adding factorials does not change the amount of the prime $p$ (= $n$) in the final product on the blackboard. The number $v_p(S')$ is then odd and therefore $S'$ is not a square.\n\nLet us assume that $n$ is a composite number (so $n \\ge 4$) in whole of the following part. We will show that we can add factorials in such a way that the final product\n\n\\[\nS' = f_1 \\cdot f_2 \\cdot f_3 \\cdots f_n,\n\\]\n\nwill be a square, where $f_k$ is either $k$ or $k!$ for all $k$. It is equivalent to $v_p(S')$ is even for all primes $p$. Since $n$ is not a prime, only primes less than $n$ occur in the product $S'$. As every such primes $p$ are not in factors $f_1, f_2, \\dots, f_{p-1}$ and the prime $p$ occurs in $f_p$ only once, the final power $v_p(S')$ is the same as in a “reduced” product\n\n\\[\np \\cdot f_{p+1} \\cdot f_{p+2} \\cdots f_n. \\qquad (1)\n\\]\n\nHow can we provide that every prime $p < n$ will occur in the corresponding product (1) with even power? Since in the second factor $f_{p+1}$ from (1) occurs the prime $p$ either once (in the case $f_{p+1} = (p+1)!$) or the prime $p$ does not occure (if $f_{p+1} = p+1$), we can provide “good” occurrence of $p$ by choice of $f_{p+1}$ independently on succeeding values $f_{p+2}, \\dots, f_n$.*\n\nForegoing analysis gives us construction of the required choice of factorials. Initially we choose $f_k \\in \\{k, k!\\}$ arbitrarily for all $k \\le n$ such that $k-1$ is not a prime. The other $f_k$, it is $f_{p+1}$, where $p$ is arbitrary prime less than $n$, will be chosen “backwards”, from the biggest such prime $p$ to the smallest prime $p = 2$.** For the biggest unchosen $f_{p+1}$ we find parity of $v_p(f_{p+2} \\dots f_n)$, in odd case we choose $f_{p+1} = p+1$, in even case we choose $f_{p+1} = (p+1)!$ and so on.\n\nThis finishes the construction of $S'$ and solution of the problem too.\n\n\\textbf{Conclusion.} Desired $n \\ge 2$ are all composite numbers.\n\n* It is correct also for a prime $p = n - 1$, where a factor $f_{p+1} = f_n$ is the last factor in (1); in this case we choose $f_n = n!$.\n** The choice of $f_3$ will be the last, it corresponds to the smallest prime $p = 2$.",

From now on, let $n \\ge 3$.\n\nWe identify boxes with points in an $n \\times n$ grid: A box of width $w$ and height $h$ corresponds to point with coordinates $(w, h)$.\n\nNo two boxes from the set $S = \\{(w,h): n \\le w+h \\le n+2\\}$ (three longest diagonals, see Fig. 1 for $n=7$) can be on the same shelf: Indeed, Assume $(w,h)$ and $(w',h')$ are on the same shelf and $w < w', h < h'$. Then $w+1 \\le w', h+1 \\le h'$, and either $w+2 \\le w'$ or $h+2 \\le h'$. Either way, summing up we obtain $w+h+3 \\le w'+h'$.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/66th_Czech_and_Slovak_p3_data_70ae86d16c.png)\n\nFig. 1\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/66th_Czech_and_Slovak_p3_data_a9d532a174.png)\n\nFig. 2\n\nIf $(w, h) \\in S$ then $w' + h' \\ge w + h + 3 \\ge n + 3$, hence $(w', h') \\notin S$. As $|S| = 3n - 2$, we need at least $3n - 2$ shelves.\n\nNow we show how to split the boxes so that $3n-2$ shelves are enough. A possible way for $n=7$ is clear from Fig. 2 (the sequences of boxes stored inside one another are illustrated by arrows) and it can be directly generalised to any $n \\ge 3$. Two boxes $(w, h)$, $(w', h')$ are put on the same shelf if and only if $2(h' - h) = w' - w$. In other words, we start with “largest” boxes $(n-1, h)$, $(n, h)$ for $h = 1, 2, \\dots, n$ and $(w, n)$ for $w = 1, 2, \\dots, n-2$, and we put each of these $3n-2$ boxes on a different shelf. Then we follow the following algorithm on each shelf: Assume the last box put on the shelf is $(w, h)$. If $w-2 \\ge 1$ and $h-1 \\ge 1$, we add box $(w-2, h-1)$ to the shelf (inside the previous box) and repeat this step; otherwise we end. Obviously, the arrangement of boxes on every shelf satisfies the requirements. Moreover, each box is stored on exactly one shelf: To identify it, keep increasing $w$ by 2 and $h$ by 1 (simultaneously) until $w \\in \\{n-1, n\\}$ or $h = n$. Thus $3n-2$ shelves are also sufficient.",

The sum of the remaining numbers is at least 15, hence the sum of at least one of the two remaining subsets is at least 8, a contradiction. Similarly we exclude $n=7$ and $n=8$ where, again, the smallest subset contains a single number.\n\nFor $n=9$ the subsets $\\{9, 8\\}$, $\\{7, 6, 3\\}$, $\\{5, 4, 2, 1\\}$ satisfy the conditions.\n\nFor $n=10$, the smallest subset contains at most 2 numbers and its sum is therefore at most 19. The sum of the remaining numbers is at least 36 and we reach contradiction as above. Similarly we exclude $n=11$.\n\nNow we describe how to create the subsets for any $n \\ge 12$. Let $n = 3k+r$, $k \\ge 4$, $r \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$. We fix the sizes of the subsets to $k-1$, $k$, $k+r+1$ and define the subsets as follows: Set $M_1$ consists of $k-1$ largest numbers from $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$, that is numbers $n-k+2, \\dots, n$. Set $M_2$ consists of the $k$ next largest numbers (that is, numbers $n-2k+2, \\dots, n-k+1$). The remaining numbers $1, \\dots, k+r+1$ form the subset $M_3$.\n\nWe aim to show that $M_1$ has larger sum than $M_2$. Since all the numbers from $M_1$ are greater than all the numbers from $M_2$, and $M_2$ has just one more element, it suffices to show that the sum of the three largest numbers of $M_1$ is greater than the sum of the four smallest numbers of $M_2$. Such three numbers always exist ($k \\ge 4$).\n\nand the desired inequality $n + (n-1) + (n-2) > (n-2k+2) + (n-2k+3) + (n-2k+4) + (n-2k+5)$ is equivalent to $8k-n > 17$ which, after plugging in $n = 3k+r$ rewrites as $5k > 17+r$. This is true as $5k \\ge 20$ and $17+r \\le 19$.\n\nSimilarly, we show that $M_2$ has larger sum than $M_3$, which has $r+1$ more elements than $M_2$: Two largest numbers of $M_2$ have larger sum than $r+3$ smallest numbers of $M_3$ as $(n-k+1) + (n-k) = 2(3k+r-k) + 1 = 4k+2r+1 \\ge 17 > 15 = 1+2+3+4+5$.\n\nThe answer is all $n \\ge 12$ together with $n = 9$.",

The same is true if we replace $(a, b, c)$ by $(-a, -b, -c)$. This simplifies the following casework.\n\nLet us suppose that numbers $a, b, c$ are such that all three fractions are integers. If one of them equals zero, without loss of generality we assume $a = 0$. Plugging this in we get that both $b/c$ and $c/b$ are integers. Hence $b$ and $c$ are nonzero and both $|b| \\le |c|$ and $|c| \\le |b|$ implying that $c = \\pm b$. Moreover, $b = c$ is the denominator of the first fraction, hence $b+c \\ne 0$ and $b = c$. Altogether, we obtain (clearly admissible) triplets $(0, c, c)$ and their permutations for any nonzero integer $c$.\n\nIt remains to solve the case $abc \\ne 0$.\n\nDue to the observations from the first paragraph we can assume that at least two of the numbers $a, b, c$ are positive. If all three were positive, the fraction with $\\min\\{a, b, c\\}$ at its numerator lies between 0 and 1 and can't be integer.\n\nAssume $a$ and $b$ are positive and $c = -d$ ($d > 0$) negative.

Hence the first one has positive denominator and since it is an integer, we have $a \\ge d-b$, i.e. $d \\le a+b$. Therefore $d = a+b$ ($c = -a-b$) and altogether we obtain triplets $(a, b, c)$ of nonzero numbers such that $a+b+c = 0$. All such triplets are admissible as the value of each fraction then equals $-1$.\n\n**Answer.** The answer consists of two families: triplets $(0, c, c)$, $(c, 0, c)$, $(c, c, 0)$, for nonzero integer $c$, and triplets $(a, b, c)$ of nonzero integers satisfying $a+b+c = 0$.",

Subtracting the second equation from the first one yields\n\n$$\n(x^2 - z^2) + ky(x - z) = z - x\n$$\n\nwhich rewrites as\n\n$$\n(x - z)(x + z + ky + 1) = 0. \\tag{1}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, subtracting the third equation from the second one yields\n\n$$\n(y - x)(y + x + kz + 1) = 0. \\tag{2}\n$$\n\nIf $x \\neq y \\neq z \\neq x$, the equations (1), (2) reduce to\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nx + z + ky + 1 &= 0, \\\\\ny + x + kz + 1 &= 0.\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSubtracting these two equations we arrive at $(y-z)(k-1) = 0$ implying that $k=1$\nand $x+y+z=-1$. However that's impossible since for $k=1$ we get\n\n$$\nz = x^2 + xy + y^2 = \\left(x + \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^2 + \\frac{3y^2}{4} \\ge 0\n$$\n\nand likewise $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0$ so altogether $x + y + z \\ge 0$.\n\nWe found out that in every solution to the original system, some two unknowns\nhave the same value. As the system is cyclic, let us from now on assume $x = y \\neq z$ (the\ncase $x = y = z$ has already been solved). Equation (1) then implies $x+y+ky+1=0$,\nthat is $x = -(k+1)y - 1$, and the original system reduces to a single equation\n\n$$\n(k + 2)y^2 + (k + 1)y + 1 = 0. \\tag{3}\n$$\n\nLet us remark that any solution to equation (3) is a solution we haven't found yet, because equality $x = y$ i.e. $y = -(k+1)y - 1$ is only possible for $k \\neq -2$ and yields $x = y = z = -1/(k+2)$ which is not a solution to the original system.\n\nFor $k = -2$ the equation (3) is linear with a unique solution $y = 1$. This yields\nsolution (0, 1, 1) and its two permutations.\n\nFor $k \\neq -2$ the equation (3) is quadratic and has real solutions if and only if\n\n$$\nD = (k + 1)^2 - 4(k + 2) = k^2 - 2k - 7 \\geq 0,\n$$\n\nwhich translates to $k \\notin (1-2\\sqrt{2}, 1+2\\sqrt{2})$. For $k = 1 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$ there is a unique solution\n\n$$\ny_0 = -\\frac{k+1}{2(k+2)} = 1 \\mp \\sqrt{2} \\quad \\text{a} \\quad x_0 = \\frac{(k+1)^2}{2(k+2)} - 1 = 1.\n$$\n\nwhich yields the three permutations of $(x_0, y_0, y_0)$ as solutions to the original system.\nFor $k \\in (-\\infty, -2) \\cup (-2, 1-2\\sqrt{2}) \\cup (1+2\\sqrt{2}, \\infty)$, the quadratic equation (3) has\ntwo distinct solutions\n\n$$\ny_{1,2} = \\frac{-k - 1 \\pm \\sqrt{k^2 - 2k - 7}}{2(k + 2)},\n$$\n\nthat give two distinct values $x_{1,2} = -(k+1)y_{1,2} - 1$. The original system thus has six solutions: three permutations of $(x_1, y_1, y_1)$ and three permutations of $(x_2, y_2, y_2)$.\n\nThe following table summarizes the number of solutions to the given system in\nterms of $k$:\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/66th_Czech_and_Slovak_p13_data_6a0c87898c.png)\n\n<table><thead><tr><th>Interval for k</th><th>(0, 0, 0)</th><th>(1/(k+2), 1/(k+2), 1/(k+2))</th><th>Equation (3)</th><th>Total</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>(-\\infty, -2)</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>-2</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>(-2, 1 - 2\\sqrt{2})</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>1 - 2\\sqrt{2}</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>(1 - 2\\sqrt{2}, 1 + 2\\sqrt{2})</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>1 + 2\\sqrt{2}</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>(1 + 2\\sqrt{2}, \\infty)</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>8</td></tr></tbody></table>",

We estimate the number of horizontal and vertical moves separately.\n\nLet us start with horizontal moves. Mark the columns as well as the tokens on the game board from left to right by the numbers 1 to $2n$. Token 1 is at the beginning in column 1 and at the end should be in column $2n$. Therefore we have to make at least $2n-1$ moves to the right. In general, token $k$ should move from column $k$ to column $2n+1-k$, and so in case $k \\le n$ it requires at least $2n+1-2k$ moves to the right, while in case $k > n$ at least $2k-2n-1$ moves to the left. Therefore, the total number of horizontal moves cannot be less than the sum\n\n\\[\n\\underbrace{(2n-1) + (2n-3) + \\dots + 1}_{\\text{for tokens 1 to } n} + \\underbrace{1 + \\dots + (2n-3) + (2n-1)}_{\\text{for tokens } n+1 \\text{ to } 2n} = \\\\ = 2(1 + 3 + \\dots + (2n-1)) = 2n^2.\n\\]\n\nHence there are at least $2n^2$ horizontal moves.\n\nNow let us focus on vertical moves. We call the token *lazy*, if it stays in the bottom line all the time; let's call the other tokens *active*. Note that there can be at most one lazy token—at the end every two tokens are in the bottom row in the opposite order than they were at the beginning; if therefore both were lazy, they would sometimes have to lie on the same cell, which is not possible. So, there are at least $2n-1$ active tokens and there were executed at least 2 vertical moves with each of them—first up and later down. There must therefore be at least $2 \\cdot (2n-1) = 4n-2$ vertical moves in total.\n\nTogether we get that we need at least $2n^2 + 4n - 2$ moves.

First, we move all $2n$ tokens except the first one to the top row. Then we move token 1 from the first column to the last one (in the bottom row). Subsequently, we move tokens 2 to $n$ subsequently; each of them first to the bottom row and then to the right to the last free square (which is its target). Finally we move tokens $n+1$ to $2n$ subsequently—each of them first to the left to its target column and then down to the bottom row.\n\nIn the procedure just described, the numbers of vertical and horizontal moves coincide with the estimates we derived in the first part of the solution: we made exactly $4n - 2$ vertical moves and we did not make more horizontal moves than necessary with any token. So the total number of moves in the described procedure is really $2n^2 + 4n - 2$.",

In the entire solution, $q$ denotes this number.\n\nSince the given numbers $n$ and $k$ are odd, the fraction with value $q$ is actually written on the board—for example, it is a fraction $\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}(k+1)}{\\frac{1}{2}(n+1)}$.\n\nAccording to the comparison with the number $q$, we call a fraction\n\n▷ *small* if its value is less than $q$,\n▷ *mean* if its value is equal to $q$,\n▷ *large* if its value is greater than $q$.\n\nThe number $k \\cdot n$ of all fractions on the board is odd. To show that the middle fraction, when they are ordered by their values, has the value $q$, it is sufficient to prove that the number of small fractions is equal to the number of the large ones. (The latter will also mean that the number of mean fractions is odd, which again confirms their existence.)\n\nWe match the fractions written on the board—we couple each fraction $i/j$ with the fraction $i'/j'$ (and vice versa) if and only if $i' = k + 1 - i$ and $j' = n + 1 - j$, which can indeed be rewritten symmetrically as $i + i' = k + 1$ and $j + j' = n + 1$. Note that the inequalities $1 \\le i \\le k$ and $1 \\le j \\le n$ apparently hold if and only if $1 \\le i' \\le k$ and $1 \\le j' \\le n$.\n\nIt is obvious that only the fraction $\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}(k+1)}{\\frac{1}{2}(n+1)}$ is „coupled“ with itself and that all the other fractions are actually divided into pairs. If we show that every such pair either consists of one small and one large fraction, or of two mean fractions, we are done.\n\nThanks to the mentioned symmetry, it suffices to verify that a fraction $i'/j'$ is small if and only if the fraction $i/j$ is large. The verification is routine:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*} \n\\frac{i'}{j'} < \\frac{k+1}{n+1} &\\Leftrightarrow \\frac{k+1-i}{n+1-j} < \\frac{k+1}{n+1} &\\Leftrightarrow (k+1-i)(n+1) < (k+1)(n+1-j) &\\Leftrightarrow \\\\ \n&\\Leftrightarrow (k+1)(n+1) - i(n+1) < (k+1)(n+1) - (k+1)j &\\Leftrightarrow \\\\ \n&\\Leftrightarrow i(n+1) > (k+1)j &\\Leftrightarrow \\frac{i}{j} > \\frac{k+1}{n+1}. \n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis completes the solution.\n\n## REMARKS.\n\n1. Instead of adjusting the inequalities at the end of the solution, we could have made this consideration: Let us take $j$ fractions with value $i/j$ and $j'$ fractions with value $i'/j'$—in total it is $j + j'$ fractions with the total sum $i + i'$, so their arithmetic mean is $(i + i')/(j + j') = (k + 1)/(n + 1) = q$. However, since we averaged at most two different values, they either has a common value $q$ or one value less than $q$ and the other value larger than $q$.\n\n2. A motivation for the chosen pairing of fractions $i/j$ and $i'/j'$ provides the following useful rule: For any quadruple of real numbers $a, b, c$, and $d$ with $b > 0$ and $d > 0$, the implication\n\n$$\n\\frac{a}{b} < \\frac{c}{d} \\Rightarrow \\frac{a}{b} < \\frac{a+c}{b+d} < \\frac{c}{d}.\n$$\n\nholds. With the notation from our solution, we only need to distinguish which of the two fractions $i/j$ and $i'/j'$ has a smaller value, and apply this implication. We obtain that the fraction with smaller value is really small and the fraction with larger value is really large.\n\n## ANOTHER SOLUTION.\nLet us look at the problem geometrically—we consider the plane with the Cartesian coordinate system $Oxy$. Each fraction $i/j$ that Martin wrote on the board is represented as a point $B$ with coordinates $[j, i]$.* We thus get exactly those points $B[j, i]$ of our plane, for which $j \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$ and $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, k\\}$. The set of these points (that we plotted in the figure for $n = 11$ a $k = 5$) we denote by $M$ and call it „the grid“. It has the shape of a rectangle with vertices $[1, 1]$, $[n, 1]$, $[n, k]$ and $[1, k]$. Since numbers $n, k$ are odd, the center $S$ of this rectangle has integer coordinates $j_0 = \\frac{1}{2}(n + 1)$ and $i_0 = \\frac{1}{2}(k + 1)$. The center $S$ is thus itself a point of the grid $M$. Let us add that the line $OS$ has the slope $i_0/j_0$ and let us denote the value of this fraction by $q$ as in the first solution.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/CZE_ABooklet_2023_p8_data_fd14d47908.png)\n\n* Due to this change of order of the numbers $i$ and $j$ the value of the considered fraction $i/j$ equals the slope of the straight line that connects the origin $O[0, 0]$ with the point $B[j, i]$.\n\nNote that the grid $M$ is point symmetric with the center $S$ (in the picture we marked two points $B$ and $B'$ where each of them is reflection of the other one).* Therefore, there is the same number of points from $M$ above and below the line $OS$. Let us clarify what distinguishes these two equally numerous groups of points „below the line $OS“ and „above the line $OS“.\n\nThe point $B[j, i]$ of the grid $M$ lies below the line $OS$ if and only if the line $OB$ has a smaller slope than the line $OS$, i.e. if $i/j < i_0/j_0 = q$ holds. Therefore, exactly those points $B[j, i]$ lie under the line $OS$ that correspond to *small* fractions $i/j$, as we called them in the first solution. Similarly, the lattice points of $M$ above the line $OS$ correspond to *large* fractions. So, there is the same number of small and large fractions.\n\n**REMARK.** In the second solution, we used symmetry with the center $S[j_0, i_0]$. This symmetry maps a point $B[j, i]$ to a point $B'[j', i']$, where (as known from analytical geometry) $j' = 2j_0 - j$ and $i' = 2i_0 - i$ hold. After substituting $j_0 = \\frac{1}{2}(n+1)$ and $i_0 = \\frac{1}{2}(k+1)$ we get symmetric equalities $j + j' = n + 1$ and $i + i' = k + 1$. We see that the pairing of fractions of the first solution exactly corresponds to symmetrical association of grid points $M$ from the second solution. So, these two solutions are actually based on the same idea.",

Next we work with this expression.\n\nAssume that $p \\mid a_n$ for some $n \\ge 2$ and for some prime $p$. Then $a_{n+1} = a_n^2 + a_n - 1 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$. From here we get for the next member $a_{n+2} = a_{n+1}^2 + a_{n+1} - 1 \\equiv (-1)^2 + (-1) - 1 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$, and so, by mathematical induction, all members $a_k$ with indices $k \\ge n+1$ give the same remainder $p-1$ modulo $p$. If the assumption $p \\mid a_n$ is satisfied for some $n \\ge 2$, we call the prime $p$ bad. Our task is actually to find infinitely many primes $p \\ge 5$ that are not bad (we impose the condition $p \\ge 5$ so that $p \\mid a_1 = 3$ does not hold).\n\nLet us now consider a prime $p$ satisfying $a_n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ for some $n \\ge 2$. Then $a_{n+1} = a_n^2 + a_n - 1 \\equiv 1^2 + 1 - 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, so using mathematical induction, we get that all numbers $a_k$ with indices $k \\ge n$ give a remainder 1 when dividing by $p$. Then let us call such $p$ good. Note that no prime $p \\ge 5$ is good and bad at the same time—because it is not possible that for sufficiently large $k$ both relations $a_k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ and $a_k \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$ hold. Therefore it is enough to prove that there are infinitely many good primes.\n\nTo find good primes we use the sequence $(b_n)_{n=1}^\\infty$ given by the formula $b_n = a_n - 1$ for each $n \\ge 1$. It is obvious that $b_1 = 2$, $b_2 = 1$ and\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nb_{n+1} &= a_{n+1} - 1 = (a_n^2 + a_n - 1) - 1 = ((b_n + 1)^2 + (b_n + 1) - 1) - 1 = \\\\\n&= b_n^2 + 3b_n = b_n(b_n + 3)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nfor every $n \\ge 2$. Then a prime number $p$ is good if and only if $p \\mid b_n$ for some $n \\ge 2$. We thus reached a situation similar to that in part a)—we need to prove existence of infinitely many primes dividing at least one member of the new sequence $(b_n)_{n=2}^\\infty$ determined by its first term $b_2 = 1$ and the relation $b_{n+1} = b_n(b_n + 3)$ for each $n \\ge 2$.\n\nWe begin with an observation that $b_k \\mid b_n$ if $2 \\le k \\le n$. Indeed from $b_{k+1} = b_k(b_k+3)$ we have $b_k \\mid b_{k+1}$ and further by induction $b_k \\mid b_n$ for every $n \\ge k$.\n\nWe now prove that, under the assumption $2 \\le k < n$, the numbers $b_k + 3$ and $b_n + 3$ are coprime. Indeed, their greatest common divisor $D$ satisfies $D \\mid b_k + 3 \\mid b_{k+1} \\mid b_n$ and at the same time $D \\mid b_n + 3$, so together $D \\mid (b_n + 3) - b_n = 3$ and therefore either $D = 1$ or $D = 3$. It remains to exclude the value $D = 3$: due to $b_2 = 1$ and the relationship $b_{n+1} = b_n(b_n + 3)$ it follows by an easy induction $b_n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$ for each $n \\ge 2$. So, $3 \\nmid b_n$, and therefore also $3 \\nmid b_n + 3$, and thus $D \\ne 3$.\n\nFinally, we know that $b_n \\ge 1$ for every $n$ (since $a_n \\ge 2$), and thus $b_n + 3 \\ge 4$. Therefore, for each $n$ we find a prime number $p_n$ with the property $p_n \\mid b_n + 3$. All these prime numbers $p_n$ are according to the previous paragraph different from each other, in addition from $b_n + 3 \\mid b_{n+1}$ follows $p_n \\mid b_{n+1}$ for every $n \\ge 2$. So we have found an infinite sequence of prime numbers dividing at least one member of the sequence $(b_n)_{n=2}^\\infty$. The proof of part b) is complete.\n\n\\textbf{REMARK.} We show that the statement from part a) can also be proved by contradiction.

Now suppose that for some $n \\ge 3$ the inequality $a_k \\ge 2$ holds for every $k < n$. Then we have $a_n = a_1a_2a_3\\dots a_{n-1} - 1 \\ge a_1a_2 - 1 = 5$, so indeed $a_n \\ge 2$.\n\nLet us now show that numbers $a_n$ are pairwise coprime. Indeed, for any two indices $k < n$ we have $a_k | a_1a_2\\dots a_{n-1} = a_n + 1$, whence for the largest common divisor $D$ of the numbers $a_n$ and $a_k$ we get $D | a_n$ and at the same time $D | a_n + 1$ (because $D | a_k$ and $a_k | a_n + 1$), so necessarily $D = 1$, so $a_n$ and $a_k$ are coprime. Due to $a_n \\ge 2$ we find for each index $n$ a prime number, denote it by $p_n$, for which $p_n | a_n$. Since all $a_n$ are pairwise coprime, the prime numbers $p_n$ are pairwise different. Thus a) is proved.\n\nb) If $n \\ge 2$, then $a_{n+1} = a_1 a_2 a_3 \\dots a_{n-1} a_n - 1 = (a_n + 1)a_n - 1 = a_n^2 + a_n - 1$. Next we work with this expression.\n\nAssume that $p \\mid a_n$ for some $n \\ge 2$ and for some prime $p$. Then $a_{n+1} = a_n^2 + a_n - 1 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$. From here we get for the next member $a_{n+2} = a_{n+1}^2 + a_{n+1} - 1 \\equiv (-1)^2 + (-1) - 1 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$, and so, by mathematical induction, all members $a_k$ with indices $k \\ge n+1$ give the same remainder $p-1$ modulo $p$. If the assumption $p \\mid a_n$ is satisfied for some $n \\ge 2$, we call the prime $p$ bad. Our task is actually to find infinitely many primes $p \\ge 5$ that are not bad (we impose the condition $p \\ge 5$ so that $p \\mid a_1 = 3$ does not hold).\n\nLet us now consider a prime $p$ satisfying $a_n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ for some $n \\ge 2$. Then $a_{n+1} = a_n^2 + a_n - 1 \\equiv 1^2 + 1 - 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, so using mathematical induction, we get that all numbers $a_k$ with indices $k \\ge n$ give a remainder 1 when dividing by $p$. Then let us call such $p$ good. Note that no prime $p \\ge 5$ is good and bad at the same time—because it is not possible that for sufficiently large $k$ both relations $a_k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ and $a_k \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$ hold. Therefore it is enough to prove that there are infinitely many good primes.\n\nTo find good primes we use the sequence $(b_n)_{n=1}^\\infty$ given by the formula $b_n = a_n - 1$ for each $n \\ge 1$. It is obvious that $b_1 = 2$, $b_2 = 1$ and\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nb_{n+1} &= a_{n+1} - 1 = (a_n^2 + a_n - 1) - 1 = ((b_n + 1)^2 + (b_n + 1) - 1) - 1 = \\\\\n&= b_n^2 + 3b_n = b_n(b_n + 3)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nfor every $n \\ge 2$. Then a prime number $p$ is good if and only if $p \\mid b_n$ for some $n \\ge 2$. We thus reached a situation similar to that in part a)—we need to prove existence of infinitely many primes dividing at least one member of the new sequence $(b_n)_{n=2}^\\infty$ determined by its first term $b_2 = 1$ and the relation $b_{n+1} = b_n(b_n + 3)$ for each $n \\ge 2$.\n\nWe begin with an observation that $b_k \\mid b_n$ if $2 \\le k \\le n$. Indeed from $b_{k+1} = b_k(b_k+3)$ we have $b_k \\mid b_{k+1}$ and further by induction $b_k \\mid b_n$ for every $n \\ge k$.\n\nWe now prove that, under the assumption $2 \\le k < n$, the numbers $b_k + 3$ and $b_n + 3$ are coprime. Indeed, their greatest common divisor $D$ satisfies $D \\mid b_k + 3 \\mid b_{k+1} \\mid b_n$ and at the same time $D \\mid b_n + 3$, so together $D \\mid (b_n + 3) - b_n = 3$ and therefore either $D = 1$ or $D = 3$. It remains to exclude the value $D = 3$: due to $b_2 = 1$ and the relationship $b_{n+1} = b_n(b_n + 3)$ it follows by an easy induction $b_n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$ for each $n \\ge 2$. So, $3 \\nmid b_n$, and therefore also $3 \\nmid b_n + 3$, and thus $D \\ne 3$.\n\nFinally, we know that $b_n \\ge 1$ for every $n$ (since $a_n \\ge 2$), and thus $b_n + 3 \\ge 4$. Therefore, for each $n$ we find a prime number $p_n$ with the property $p_n \\mid b_n + 3$. All these prime numbers $p_n$ are according to the previous paragraph different from each other, in addition from $b_n + 3 \\mid b_{n+1}$ follows $p_n \\mid b_{n+1}$ for every $n \\ge 2$. So we have found an infinite sequence of prime numbers dividing at least one member of the sequence $(b_n)_{n=2}^\\infty$. The proof of part b) is complete.\n\nREMARK. We show that the statement from part a) can also be proved by contradiction. Let us assume that there are only finitely many primes that divide some members of the sequence $(a_n)_{n=1}^\\infty$—let us denote them $p_1, \\dots, p_k$. Surely we can find an index $r$ so large that among the divisors of the first $r$ terms $a_1, \\dots, a_r$ are all primes $p_1, \\dots, p_k$. Then, of course, the following member $a_{r+1} = a_1 a_2 \\dots a_r - 1$ is an integer, not divisible by any of these prime numbers, and that is (due to $a_{r+1} \\ge 2$) a contradiction.",

Let us admit that some four factors of the number 720 have the property that none of them divides the product of the other three factors. Then each of them contains in its prime decomposition some of the primes 2, 3, 5 to a higher power than it has in its decomposition the product of the other three factors, and therefore any one of them. But there are four divisors and only three prime numbers, and this is the contradiction.",

Similarly, the second equation implies $x > 2$.\n\nNow we prove that the numbers $x$ and $y$ must be equal.* We will use the observation that the function *square root* is increasing. If $x > y$, then\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\sqrt{x} + 2} > \\sqrt{\\sqrt{y} + 2},\n$$\n\ni.e. $y - 2 > x - 2$, $y > x$, and that is a contradiction. The case $x < y$ is eliminated similarly. The equality of $x = y$ is thus proved.\n\nLet us therefore deal with the (only possible) case $x = y$ next. The original system of two equations is then obviously reduced to a single equation\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\sqrt{x} + 2} = x - 2. \\qquad (1)\n$$\n\nAfter substituting $s = \\sqrt{x}$, when $x = s^2$, the equation (1) becomes $\\sqrt{s+2} = s^2-2$, while obviously $s > \\sqrt{2}$. For each such $s$, we square the equality to obtain $s+2 = (s^2-2)^2$, which we rewrite in the form $s^4 - 4s^2 - s + 2 = 0$. Note that this equation has a root $s = 2$. This is confirmed by the decomposition\n\n$$s^4 - 4s^2 - s + 2 = s^2(s^2 - 4) - (s - 2) = s^2(s - 2)(s + 2) - (s - 2) = (s - 2)(s^3 + 2s^2 - 1),$$\nby which we now show that $s = 2$ is the only root of the derived equation, that satisfies our condition $s > \\sqrt{2}$. Indeed, for every $s > \\sqrt{2}$, $s^3 + 2s^2 - 1 > 0$ (this is even true for $s \\ge 1$). The only satisfactory value of $s = 2$ corresponds to the only solution $x = s^2 = 4$ of the equation (1), and therefore to the only solution $x = y = 4$ of the given problem.\n\n* Let us emphasize that the equality $x = y$ does not follow from the mere symmetry of the system.\n\n*Conclusion.* The given system of equations has a unique solution $(x, y) = (4, 4)$.\n\nREMARK. Let us give a second possible derivation of $x = y$.\n\nWe begin the new proof of the equality $x = y$ by taking squares of both equations\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} \\sqrt{x} + 2 &= (y - 2)^2, \\\\ \\sqrt{y} + 2 &= (x - 2)^2. \\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBy subtracting the second equation from the first we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} \\sqrt{x} - \\sqrt{y} &= (y - 2)^2 - (x - 2)^2 = ((y - 2) - (x - 2))((y - 2) + (x - 2)) = \\\\ &= (y - x)(x + y - 4) = (\\sqrt{y} - \\sqrt{x})(\\sqrt{y} + \\sqrt{x})(x + y - 4). \\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAssuming that $x \\neq y$, after dividing the two outer expressions by $\\sqrt{y} - \\sqrt{x} \\neq 0$, we get\n\n$$\n-1 = (\\sqrt{y} + \\sqrt{x})(x + y - 4).\n$$\n\nHowever, as we know, both $x$ and $y$ are greater than 2, so the right-hand side of the last equation is positive, which is a contradiction.\n\nANOTHER SOLUTION. We again use the observation that both numbers $x$ and $y$ are greater than 2, and introduce the function $f: (2, \\infty) \\to (2, \\infty)$, $f(t) = \\sqrt{t} + 2$ for every $t > 2$. The equations from the problem, rewritten in the form\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} \\sqrt{\\sqrt{x} + 2} + 2 &= y, \\\\ \\sqrt{\\sqrt{y} + 2} + 2 &= x \\end{aligned}\n$$\n\ncan then be written as a system of equations using the function $f$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} f(f(x)) &= y, \\\\ f(f(y)) &= x. \\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe see that its solutions are just pairs of the form $(x, y) = (x, f(f(x)))$, where the number $x$ satisfies the relation $f(f(f(x))) = x$. This is certainly satisfied in the case where $f(x) = x$. We show that the equality holds only in this case.\n\nIf $f(x) < x$ we have a quadruple of inequalities\n\n$$\nf\\left(f\\left(f\\left(f(x)\\right)\\right)\\right) < f\\left(f\\left(f(x)\\right)\\right) < f(f(x)) < f(x) < x\n$$\n\nwhere the last inequality is obvious and every previous inequality is the consequence of the immediately following inequality and the fact that $f$ is increasing. Similarly in the case of $f(x) > x$ we have*\n\n$$\nf\\left(f\\left(f(f(x))\\right)\\right) > f\\left(f(f(x))\\right) > f(f(x)) > f(x) > x.\n$$\n\nThus, we have proved equivalence of $f\\left(f\\left(f(f(x))\\right)\\right) = x$ and $f(x) = x$.\n\nIt remains to solve the equation $f(x) = x$ with unknown $x > 2$, which is easy:\n\n$$\nf(x) = x \\Leftrightarrow \\sqrt{x} + 2 = x \\Leftrightarrow 0 = (\\sqrt{x} - 2)(\\sqrt{x} + 1) \\Leftrightarrow \\sqrt{x} = 2 \\Leftrightarrow x = 4.\n$$\n\nWe arrive at the same conclusion as in the first solution.\n\n* To the above quadruple of inequalities, let us add that the case $f(x) < x$ occurs for every $x > 4$ and the case $f(x) > x$ occurs for every $x \\in (2, 4)$. This follows obviously from the decomposition of $f(x) - x = (2 - \\sqrt{x})(\\sqrt{x} + 1)$, which we will also use in solving the equation $f(x) = x$.\n\nREMARK. The reasoning about the function $f$ from the second solution can also be used to solve equation (1) from the first solution without considering the fourth degree equation. Indeed, the equation (1) can be written as the equation $f(f(x)) = x$, which is, of course, equivalent to the simpler equation $f(x) = x$, due to the implications\n\n$$\nf(x) < x \\Rightarrow f(f(x)) < f(x) < x \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f(x) > x \\Rightarrow f(f(x)) > f(x) > x,\n$$\n\nwhich is justified in the same way as in the second solution. There we also solved the simplified equation $f(x) = x$.",

In the following paragraph we prove that $R$ lies inside the angle $ABC$ and $S$ inside the angle $DCB$, as in our figure. Together, this means that points $A, D, R, S$ lie inside the same half-plane with the boundary line $BC$.\n\nThe assumption $|\\angle APD| < 90^\\circ$ implies $|\\angle APB| > 90^\\circ$, which for the interior point $P$ of the base $AC$ of the isosceles triangle $ABC$ means that $|\\angle ABP| < \\frac{1}{2} |\\angle ABC|$; hence $|\\angle ABR| = 2 \\cdot |\\angle ABP| < |\\angle ABC|$, hence the point $R$ is actually inside the angle $ABC$. Analogously from the inequality $|\\angle DPC| > 90^\\circ$ for the interior point $P$ of the base $BD$ of isosceles triangle $DCB$, we conclude that the point $S$ actually lies inside the angle $DCB$.\n\nA further consequence of the inequality $|\\angle APD| < 90^\\circ$ is that for the marked interior angles of the right triangles $APX$ and $DPY$, $|\\angle XAP| = 90^\\circ - |\\angle APD| = |\\angle YDP|$, i.e. $|\\angle RAC| = |\\angle SDB|$.\n\nLet us return to the equalities (1). According to these, the point $B$ is the circumcenter of the triangle $ARC$, which evidently lies in the angle $ABC$. Therefore, according to the inscribed angle theorem $|\\angle RBC| = 2 \\cdot |\\angle RAC|$. By a similar reasoning about the circumcenter $C$ of the triangle $BSD$ in the angle $BCD$ we obtain $|\\angle SCB| = 2 \\cdot |\\angle SDB|$. From the last two paragraphs we get the equality $|\\angle RBC| = |\\angle SCB|$. This, together with (1), leads to the conclusion that (isosceles) triangles $RBC$ and $SCB$ are congruent by the $SAS$ theorem. Hence, their altitudes from the vertices of $R$ and $S$ to the side $BC$ have the same length. This already implies that $BC \\parallel RS.$\n\n\\textbf{ANOTHER SOLUTION.} We show that the points $R$ and $S$ lie on the circumcircle of $BCP$. We write the detailed proof only for the point $R$, for the point $S$ the proof is analogous.\n\nAs in the first solution, we derive (1) and observe that $R$ lies inside the angle $ABC$. From the condition $|\\angle APD| < 90^\\circ$ it also follows that $R$ lies in the half plane $ACD$.\n\nAccording to (1), $B$ is the circumcenter of $ARC$, whose central angle $RBA$ with the bisector $BD$ is therefore twice the angle $RCA$. Therefore the three angles $PBA$, $RBP$ and $RCP$ marked in the figure are congruent. Congruence of the last two angles with respect to the previous paragraph already means that the point $R$ does indeed lie on the circumcircle of $BCP$. For the point $S$ the same is true due to the analogous congruence of the angles $PCD$, $SCP$ and $SBP$.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/CZE_ABooklet_2023_p20_data_eacb2bb972.png)\n\nIt follows from the proof that the points $B$, $C$, $R$, $S$ lie on one circle, while the points $R$ and $S$ lie in the same half-plane with the boundary line $BC$. Hence the congruence of the angles $BRC$ and $BSC$, which, together with the equality $|BC| = |BR| = |CS|$, means that the isosceles triangles $RBC$ and $SCB$ are congruent. The congruence of their altitudes proves the relation $BC \\parallel RS$.\n\n\\emph{Instead of consideration of the congruent triangles $CBR$ and $BCS$, it suffices to state, that the congruent segments $BR$ and $CS$ are symmetrically clustered along the axis of the line segment $BC$.}",

Indeed, two of the three numbers $a$, $b$, $c$ have the same parity, so their sum is even.\n\nIf the product we investigate is a power of a prime $p$, then each of the four factors must be a power of $p$. As we already know, one of the first three factors is even, so $p = 2$. Each of the four factors is therefore a power of two, which is greater than $1 = 2^0$, since the numbers $a, b, c$ are positive integers. Hence, each factor is an even number.\n\nFurther observe that the numbers $a+b$, $a+c$, $b+c$ are all even numbers, if and only if the numbers $a, b, c$ all have the same parity. Since $a+b+c+2036$ is even, $a, b$ and $c$ must be even numbers. Therefore, we can write $a = 2a_1$, $b = 2b_1$, and $c = 2c_1$, where $a_1, b_1, c_1$ are positive integers. Then of course\n\n\\[\n(a+b)(a+c)(b+c)(a+b+c+2036) = 2^4(a_1+b_1)(a_1+c_1)(b_1+c_1)(a_1+b_1+c_1+1018).\n\\]\n\nThe product of the last four parentheses must be a power of two. The numbers $a_1, b_1, c_1$ are therefore solutions to the original problem with the constant 2036 replaced by 1018. For the same reason as above $a_1, b_1$, and $c_1$ must be even. We denote by $a_2, b_2$ and $c_2$ respectively their halves (they are again positive integers) and we get\n\n\\[\n(a+b)(a+c)(b+c)(a+b+c+2036) = 2^8(a_2+b_2)(a_2+c_2)(b_2+c_2)(a_2+b_2+c_2+509).\n\\]\n\nAnd again, we have the same problem with the constant 509, so the numbers $a_2, b_2$, and $c_2$ necessarily have the same parity. However, since the number 509 is odd, $a_2, b_2$ and $c_2$ must be odd numbers. We see that the triple $a_2 = b_2 = c_2 = 1$ satisfies the problem (since $3 + 509 = 512$ is a power of two), so the corresponding triple $a = b = c = 4$ is a solution to the original problem. We show that it is the only solution.\n\nSuppose that at least one of the numbers $a_2, b_2, c_2$ is greater than one, let it be $c_2$ without loss of generality. Then, of course, the power of two equal to $a_2+c_2$ is greater than 2, so it is divisible by four. This means that dividing by four one of the numbers $a_2, c_2$ gives a remainder of 1 and the other a remainder of 3. So the third odd number $b_2$ has the same remainder when divided by four as one of the numbers $a_2, c_2$. The sum of $b_2$ with this number then has a remainder of 2, and since this sum is also a power of two, it must be the power of $2^1$. It follows that $b_2 = 1$ and $a_2 = 1$ (the equality of $c_2 = 1$ is ruled out by our assumption $c_2 > 1$). Thus the remainder 3 when divided by four necessarily gives $c_2$. But then the number $a_2+b_2+c_2+509$ gives remainder 2, so it is not a power of two, and that is a contradiction.\n\n**Conclusion.** A single triple $(a, b, c) = (4, 4, 4)$ satisfies the problem statement.",

The product $(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)(a+b+c+2036)$ is a power of some prime number if and only if powers of that prime are all four factors of $a+b, b+c, c+a$, and $a+b+c+2036$. So let $a+b = p^k, c+a = p^l$, and $b+c = p^m$ for some prime $p$ and non-negative integers $k, l$ and $m$. For these, by the theorem of the introduction $k \\ge l \\ge m \\ge 1$.\n\nIf $k > l$, and hence $k-1 \\ge l$ and $k-1 \\ge m$, with respect to $p \\ge 2$, we would have\n\n\\[\na+b = p^k \\ge p^{k-1} + p^{k-1} \\ge p^l + p^m = (c+a) + (b+c) > a+b,\n\\]\n\nwhich is impossible. Necessarily, then, $k=l$, so $a+b = p^k = p^l = c+a$, where $b=c$. Then of course $p^m = b+c = 2b$, and so $b=c = p^m/2$, so $2|p$, e.g. $p=2$, and therefore $b=c = 2^{m-1}$ and $a+b = 2^k$. Since $p=2$, it is also $a+b+c+2036 = 2^n$ for some integer $n$, which obviously satisfies the condition $2^n > 2036$.\n\nBy the conclusion of the previous paragraph, the numbers $k, m, n$ satisfy the equality\n\n\\[\n2^n = (a+b) + c + 2036 = 2^k + 2^{m-1} + 2036.\n\\]\n\nNote that dividing by 16 number 2036 gives the remainder of 4, while $2^n$ certainly gives a remainder of 0 if $2^n > 2036$.* This implies $2^k + 2^{m-1} \\equiv 12 \\pmod{16}$. The summands $2^k$ and $2^{m-1}$—as powers of two—are congruent to 1, 2, 4, 8 or 0 (mod 16). It is easy to see that the derived congruence holds only if one of the powers of $2^k, 2^{m-1}$ yields a residue of 4 and the other 8. Then $k, m-1 = 2, 3$. However, since $2^{m-1} = b < a+b = 2^k$, it is necessarily $m-1 < k$, and therefore $m-1=2$ and $k=3$. Hence $b=c=2^{m-1}=4$ and $a+b=2^k=8$, whence also $a=4$. This gives us the only possible triple $(a, b, c) = (4, 4, 4)$. This is indeed the solution to the problem—the product of the problem is then $8 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 2048$, while $8=2^3$ and $2048 = 2^{11}$.\n\nREMARK. Why did we solve the equation $2^n = 2^k + 2^{m-1} + 2036$ reasoning by divisibility by 16? It was an appropriate way of solving this equation rewritten in the binary system (which we wanted to avoid), in which each power of two has a form of $100...0$, while the number 2036 has 11-digit notation `111 1111 0100`. In order to add two powers of 2 to get a power again, it is clear that the notation of the lesser power must be 100 and that of the greater power must be 1000, i.e. they are the powers determined by their remainders when divided by $2^4 = 16$.",

We show that after at most 34 rounds, Alice can force a situation where three empty adjacent cells exist.*\n\nThe empty cells are then divided into several continuous sections, each consisting of one or two cells. There are at least two sections consisting of two cells—dividing all 72 cells into 36 pairs of adjacent cells, at least one pair remains empty; then we use the second possible pairing and find another empty pair.\n\nAlice places a marker between each two empty adjacent cells and she corrects the position of one marker after each round.

Each of them contains at least 3 cells, it starts and ends with an empty cell and does not contain two adjacent empty cells. Alice can certainly select from these segments one, let's call it *U*, that has fewer chips than empty cells (since this inequality holds for their total numbers).\n\nLet $k \\ge 1$ be such that the selected segment $U$ contains $k+1$ empty cells and at most $k$ chips. However, these chips must be exactly $k$, since any two consecutive empty cells must be separated by a cell with a chip. Thus, the section $U$ consists of $2k+1$ cells for which and $2k+1 \\le 72-3=69$, i.e. $k \\le 34$.

Then she brings the game to an end in the next turn.\n\n**REMARK.** It can be proved that there must be at least two segments of odd length. Alice can then choose the segment $U$ from the previous solution so that it consists of at most 35 cells. In addition, Alice can modify her strategy so that in the segment $U$ she points not to the outside cell but to the middle empty cell, or to one of the cells next to the middle occupied cell. Then, after Ben's move, a new marker will appear in $U$ that splits $U$ into two sections and Alice then selects the shorter of them. Repeating this procedure gives Alice a sequence of sections with number of cells that does not exceed 35, 17, 7, 3, and 1, respectively, so Alice ends the game no later than in the fifth round.",

So it is enough to prove that there are infinitely many primes that divide at least one member of a given sequence. This observation is a consequence of a stronger claim, namely that \\textit{for every $n \\ge 1$ is number $a_{2n+3}$ divisible by at least $n$ different primes}. Proof of this statement will not be given here.",

Let us consider the three fields A, B, C as shown in Figure 1.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/CZE_ABooklet_2023_p28_data_245e853cbd.png)\n\nFigure 1\n\nLet us note that in each step, the field A is recolored and exactly one of the fields B or C is recolored. If after a certain number of steps all 9 fields are black, the number of recolorings of B and C would be odd, so the number of recolorings of A would be even, and therefore, the field A would be white in the end, which is a contradiction. Henceforth, we will assume that $n \\ge 4$. We prove the assertion from the introductory paragraph of the solution in three steps.\n\n(i) If $n$ is even, we use the procedure of Figure 2 repeatedly, in which we in four steps change colors of exactly 4 fields in a $4 \\times 4$ square. We divide the $n \\times n$ grid into $(\\frac{1}{2}n)^2$ squares $2 \\times 2$ and change color in each square by the above procedure. For those squares that are on the border of the grid, we rotate Fig. 2 appropriately to make the corresponding $4 \\times 4$ square lie entirely inside the grid.\n\n* We will thus furthermore preferably to mean both changing the color of a square from white to black and vice versa.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/CZE_ABooklet_2023_p29_data_77cde2c78d.png)\n\nFigure 2\n\n(ii) If $n$ is divisible by three, we repeatedly use the procedure on Figure 3, which first uses the construction 2 twice. In this way, we change colors of 9 fields forming a $3 \\times 3$ square that lies in a $4 \\times 5$ rectangle (see the purple bordered area). Similarly to part (i) we apply this procedure to the individual $3 \\times 3$ squares and for the boundary squares, we again rotate the situation on the figure 3 appropriately, so that the required $4 \\times 5$ rectangle lies entirely inside the grid.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/CZE_ABooklet_2023_p29_data_d32dafea0f.png)\n\nFigure 3\n\n(iii) We now assume that $n$ is not divisible by two, or three. The fields in each line we denote by numbers 0, 1, 2, 0, ... as in the figure 4.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/CZE_ABooklet_2023_p29_data_5c92cf0869.png)\n\nFigure 4\n\nLet $a_i$ denote the number of black fields with the number $i$, $i \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$. Note that parity of each of the three numbers $a_i$ changes in each step, since we change the color in some of the fields in only three adjacent columns, and in each of them we change the colour of an odd number of cells. Since at the beginning we have $a_0 = a_1 = a_2 = 0$, after any number of steps, $a_0 \\equiv a_1 \\equiv a_2 \\pmod 2$.\n\nBy assumption 3 $\\nmid n$, so number of squares with number 0 is by $n$ (one whole column) larger than number of those with number 2. If after several steps all the boxes were colored black, we would have $a_0 - a_2 = n$, which due to $2 \\nmid n$ would mean that the numbers $a_0$ and $a_2$ have different parity.

This means that no integer $n \\ge 100$ has the desired property.\n\nConsider the collection of 99 tetraminoes of type O and one tetramino of type T. If we color the table $20 \\times 20$ as a checkboard, it will contain 200 black and 200 white cells. 99 tetraminos of type O cover 198 black and 198 white cells. Thus, there will be 2 black and 2 white cells remaining. However, they can not be covered by a tetramino of type T, since it always covers 3 cells of the same color. This concludes the first part of the solution. In the second part, we will show that the number $n = 99$ has the desired property. We describe the way of putting any collection of 99 tetraminos inside the table. We will use the following figures:\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/CZE_ABooklet_2024_p11_data_51091ec6d1.png)\n\nFrom the picture, we can see how we can fill the square $4 \\times 4$ with four tetraminoes T and how to fill a rectangle $4 \\times 2$ with two tetraminoes from each of the types O, I, L. We put them to the table all such squares and rectangles that we can create from the given collection of 99 tetraminoes (squares first, then the rectangles) by layers of 4 rows. Since each row contains 20 cells which is a multiple of 4, the new layer will be started only if the previous layer is completely covered. We realize, that at the moment when there is no rectangle left, the following conditions hold:\n\n* The collection of the tetraminoes that are left (which we denote by $\\mathcal{Z}$) is a subset of the collection $1 \\times O, 1 \\times L, 1 \\times I, 3 \\times T$. Thus, for the number $k$ of tetraminos in collection $\\mathcal{Z}$ holds $k \\le 6$.\n* There are $4(k+1)$ uncovered cells which form a rectangle $4 \\times (k+1)$.\n* The number 99 − $k$ of tetraminoes in the squares and rectangles is even, thus the number $k \\le 6$ is odd, and therefore $k \\in \\{1, 3, 5\\}$.\n\nIt remains to put the $k$ tetraminoes from the collection $\\mathcal{Z}$ to the table $4 \\times (k+1)$. We distinguish three cases based on the value of $k \\in \\{1, 3, 5\\}$. Moreover, for $k=3$ and $k=5$ we use the division of the table $4 \\times (k+1)$ to the parts A, B, and C, that is in the pictures. Clearly, any tetramino can be put inside a rectangle $4 \\times 2$ and also part A. To parts B and C, we can fit a tetramino of each of the types O, L, and T.\n\nCase $k = 1$. To the table $4 \\times 2$ we put the tetramino from the collection $\\mathcal{Z}$.\n\nCase $k = 3$. To part A we put one of the tetramino of the collection $\\mathcal{Z}$, preferring the type $I$. We put the other two tetraminoes from $\\mathcal{Z}$ to parts B a C.\n\nCase $k = 5$. The collection $\\mathcal{Z}$ contains two or three tetraminoes of the type T. We put two of them to the table as in the picture. The other three tetraminoes we put inside the parts A, B, and C, putting the type I inside A if present in $\\mathcal{Z}$.",

Clearly, two congruent circles with all tangent conditions from the statement exist. Denote them by $k_1(S_1, r)$ and $k_2(S_2, r)$ such that $k_1$ is tangent to $AC$ (and $k_2$ is tangent to $BC$). Moreover, denote the tangent points of these two circles to $AB$ by $T_1$ and $T_2$, respectively, as in the picture. Consider the incircle $k(S, \\varrho)$ of the triangle $ABC$ and denote $D$ the tangent point of $k$ with $AB$.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/CZE_ABooklet_2024_p14_data_d072271dd3.png)\n\nIn the first part of the solution we show that the radius $r$ of circles $k_1$ and $k_2$ is determined by the equation\n\n$$\nr = \\frac{c(a + b - c)}{2(a + b)} \\qquad (1)\n$$\n\nIn homothety with center $A$ and coefficient $r/\\varrho$ which maps $k$ to $k_1$, the point $D$ is mapped to the point $T_1$. Therefore, $|AT_1| = |AD| \\cdot r/\\varrho$. Analogously, we get the equation $|BT_2| = |BD| \\cdot r/\\varrho$. Since $T_1T_2S_2S_1$ is a rectangle, we have $|T_1T_2| = |S_1S_2| = 2r$. After plugging everything in the equation $c = |AT_1| + |T_1T_2| + |BT_2|$, by using the relation $|AD| + |BD| = c$ we obtain\n\n$$\nc = |AD| \\cdot \\frac{r}{\\varrho} + 2r + |BD| \\cdot \\frac{r}{\\varrho} = 2r + (|AD| + |BD|) \\cdot \\frac{r}{\\varrho} = 2r + \\frac{cr}{\\varrho}.\n$$\n\nThis yields\n\n$$\nr = \\frac{c\\varrho}{c + 2\\varrho}.\n$$\n\nAfter using the well-known formula $\\varrho = (a + b - c)/2$, we obtain the desired formula 1. Suppose that the lengths $a, b, c, r$ are integers and put $k = \\gcd(a, b, c)$. Then $a = ka_1$, $b = kb_1$ and $c = kc_1$. Moreover, the Pythagorean theorem $a_1^2 + b_1^2 = c_1^2$ implies that the numbers $a_1, b_1, c_1$ are pairwise coprime and $a_1$ and $b_1$ have different parity. The number $c_1$ is odd and the number $a_1 + b_1 - c_1$ is even. After plugging in $a = ka_1$, $b = kb_1$ and $c = kc_1$ to 1 we obtain:\n\n$$\nr = \\frac{kc_1(a_1 + b_1 - c_1)}{2(a_1 + b_1)} = \\frac{k}{a_1 + b_1} \\cdot c_1 \\cdot \\frac{a_1 + b_1 - c_1}{2}. \\qquad (2)\n$$\n\nWe will show that not only the second fraction, but also the first fraction of the right-hand side of 2 is an integer. Suppose that there is a prime $p$ that divides both $a_1 + b_1$ and $c_1$. Then from the equation $(a_1 + b_1)^2 = c_1^2 + 2a_1b_1$ we have $p \\mid a_1b_1$, which is a contradiction since the numbers $a_1, b_1$ and $c_1$ are pairwise coprime. Thus, the number $a_1 + b_1$ is coprime to $c_1$ and also $a_1 + b_1 - c_1$. Since $r$ is an integer, from the equation 2 it follows, that the first fraction is an integer.\n\nBy the problem statement, $r$ is a prime. By 2 it is a product of three positive integers. Since $c_1 > a_1 \\ge 1$, we necessarily have $c_1 = r$ and the other two fraction in the right-hand side of 2 are equal to 1. Therefore, we have $k = a_1 + b_1$, $a_1 + b_1 - c_1 = 2$ and also $k = a_1 + b_1 = c_1 + 2 = r + 2$. It follows that\n\n$$\n2a_1b_1 = (a_1 + b_1)^2 - c_1^2 = (r + 2)^2 - r^2 = 4r + 4.\n$$\n\nAfter dividing by two we obtain\n\n$$\na_1b_1 = 2r + 2 = 2(a_1 + b_1 - 2) + 2 = 2a_1 + 2b_1 - 2.\n$$\n\nThe last equation can be rewritten in the form $(a_1 - 2)(b_1 - 2) = 2$. It easily follows that $\\{a_1, b_1\\} = \\{3, 4\\}$, $c_1 = r = a_1 + b_1 - 2 = 5$, and $k = r + 2 = 7$. For right-angled triangle with sides $7 \\cdot 3, 7 \\cdot 4$ and $7 \\cdot 5$ we, indeed, have $r = 5$. This completes the proof.",
