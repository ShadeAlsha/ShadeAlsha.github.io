Thus (b) is equivalent to the statement that NI is perpendicular to the Euler-line.\n\nSince O, H, N are on the Euler-line and N is the midpoint of OH, we have:\n\n(b) $\\Leftrightarrow NI$ is the perpendicular bisector of OH.\n\nBut the perpendicular bisector of O, H is simply the locus of all points P such that $OP = HP$. Thus (b) $\\Leftrightarrow IH = IO$.\n\n\\textbf{Claim 2:} $IH = IO \\Leftrightarrow AH = AO$ or $A, H, O, I$ are conicyclic.\n\nBecause H and O are isogonal conjugates $\\angle HAI = \\angle OAH$. Also AI is common. Thus the condition $AH = AO$ gives that $\\triangle AHI$ and $\\triangle OHI$ are congruent. This gives $IH = IO$.\n\nIf on the other hand A, H, O, I are con-cyclic, then IH and IO subtend the same angle at A. This implies that $IH = IO$.\n\nThus $AH = AO$ or $A, H, O, I$ con-cyclic implies that $IH = IO$.\n\nConversely, suppose $IH = IO$. Then $\\frac{IH}{AI} = \\frac{IO}{AI}$. This implies that\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sin \\angle HAI}{\\sin \\angle AHI} = \\frac{\\sin \\angle OAI}{\\sin \\angle AOI}\n$$\n\nIt follows that $\\sin \\angle AHI = \\sin \\angle AOI$ since AI bisects $\\angle HAO$. This tells that $\\angle AHI + \\angle AOI = \\pi$ or $\\angle AHI = \\angle AOI$. In the first case A, H, O, I are conicyclic. In the second case $AH = AO$.\n\nThus we have shown that $IH = IO$ if and only if A, H, O, I are con-cyclic or $AH = AO$.\n\n\\textbf{Claim 3:} $IH = IO$ if and only if $AH = AO$, or $BH = BO$, or $CH = CO$\n\nSuppose $IH = IO$. Clearly the circum-circle of $\\triangle HOI$ does not pass through all of A, B, C, because then O would lie on the circum-circle of $\\triangle A, B, C$. Without loss of generality, assume that it does not pass through A. Then $AH = AO$, because $IH = IO$ and A, H, O, I are not conicyclic. (In the other two cases, we have $BH = BO$ or $CH = CO$ depending on whether the circum-circle does not pass through B or C respectively.) The other part follows directly from claim 2.\n\n\\textbf{Claim 4:} $AH = AO$, $BH = BO$ or $CH = CO$ if and only if angles of ABC are in arithmetic progression.\n\nLet R be the circum-radius so that $AO = BC = CO = R$. Then $AH = 2R\\cos A$, $BH = 2R\\cos B$, and $CH = 2R\\cos C$. Thus $AH = AO \\Leftrightarrow A = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$; $BH = BO \\Leftrightarrow B = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$; $CH = CO \\Leftrightarrow C = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$.\n\nNow $AH = AO$, $BH = BO$ or $CH = CO$ implies that one of the angles of triangle ABC is $\\pi/3$. But clearly, one angle is $\\pi/3$ if and only if angles are in arithmetic progression.\n\nThus (b) $\\Leftrightarrow IH = IO$ (by claim 1) $\\Leftrightarrow AH = AO$, $BH = BO$, or $CH = CO$ (by claim 3) $\\Leftrightarrow$ angles are in arithmetic progression which is (a).",

However, for $n=4$, we see that the strings are $XXOX$, $XXOO$, $XOXX$, $XOXO$, $XOOX$, $OXXO$, $OXOX$, $OXOO$, $OOXX$, $OOXO$ and hence $b_4 = 10$.\n\nLet $x_n, y_n, z_n$ respectively denote the number of balanced strings of length $n$ that end with $XX$; that end with $XO$ and whose last occurrence of a double letter was $XX$; and that end with $XO$, but whose last occurrence of a double letter was $OO$.

This shows that $b_n = 2x_n + 2y_n + 2z_n - 2$ (we count purely alternating strings XOXO... XO and OXOX... OX twice; once among $y_n$ and once among $z_n$). Thus $b_n + 2 = 2(x_n + y_n + z_n)$.

Further, $x^2 + (2y - 2z)^2 > 0 \\Rightarrow 9x^2 > 4y^2 + 4z^2 + 8yz \\Rightarrow 3x > 2y + 2z \\Rightarrow u(x, y, z) > 0$.\n\nSimilarly, we have $4y > 3z \\Rightarrow 4yz - 3z^2 > 0 \\Rightarrow 4y^2 + z^2 + 4yz > 4x^2 \\Rightarrow 2y + z > 2x \\Rightarrow v(x, y, z) > 0$.\n\nNext, $(3y - 4z)^2 > 0 \\Rightarrow 25x^2 + (3y - 4z)^2 > 25x^2 \\Rightarrow 25x^2 > 16y^2 + 9z^2 + 24yz \\Rightarrow 25x^2 > (4y + 3x)^2 \\Rightarrow 5x > 4y + 3z \\Rightarrow u(x, y, z) > v(x, y, z)$.\n\nSimilarly, we have $u(x, y, z) > w(x, y, z)$. Also, since $x > y$, it follows that $u(x, y, z) > -w(x, y, z)$. And, $y > z$ implies $v(x, y, z) > w(x, y, z)$. Finally, we notice that if $y + z > x$ then it follows that $u(x, y, z) < x$. Now, let\n\n$$\nf_1(x, y, z) = (u, v, w),\n$$\n\n$$\ng_1(x, y, z) = (u, v, -w),\n$$\n\n$$\nh_1(x, y, z) = (u, -w, v).\n$$\n\nThen, it is easy to see that $f_1(f(x, y, z)) = g_1(g(x, y, z)) = h_1(h(x, y, z)) = (x, y, z)$. Further, it is easy to check that $\\text{gcd}(u, v, w) = \\text{gcd}(x, y, z)$.\n\nNow, we shall prove the result by contradiction. If there are primitive Pythagorean triplets that are not obtained from $(5, 4, 3)$ by repeated application of $f, g$ and $h$ in some order, then let $(a, b, c)$ be the triplet that cannot be obtained from $(5, 4, 3)$ with $a > b > c > 0$ and with least possible value for $a$. So, all the primitive Pythagorean triplets $(x, y, z)$ with $a > x > y > z > 0$ are obtained from $(5, 4, 3)$ (uniquely). Clearly, we have $a > 5$.\n\nNow, let $f_1(a, b, c) = (k, l, m)$. Then, $g_1(a, b, c) = (k, l, -m)$ and $h_1(a, b, c) = (k, -m, l)$. As noted before, $k$ and $l$ are positive, and $k > l, k > m$ and $k > -m$. Thus, there is a unique $\\Delta \\in \\{f_1, g_1, h_1\\}$ such that $\\Delta(a, b, c) = (r, s, t)$ with $r > s > t > 0$. Also, from the previous calculations, we have\nthat $a > r$. Thus, by the minimality of $a$, it follows that $(r, s, t)$ is obtained from $(5, 4, 3)$, in a unique way, by repeated applications of $f, g, h$ in some order. But, now $\\Delta(a, b, c) = (r, s, t)$ implies that by applying one of $f, g$ and $h$ to $(r, s, t)$ we would get $(a, b, c)$. Therefore, we can obtain $(a, b, c)$ from $(5, 4, 3)$ by repeated applications of $f, g, h$ in some order. This is a contradiction. Uniqueness follows from the uniqueness of $\\Delta$.

In this case, we have $(x-p,x) = (x,x+p) = 1$. If $x$ is even, then $(x-p,x+p) = 1$, so it follows that $x-p,x$ and $x+p$ are all squares. This is not possible since $x+p \\equiv 3 \\pmod 8$. Thus, $x$ has to be odd. In this case we have $(x-p,x+p) = 2$. So we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} x &= r^2, \\\\ (x-p) &= 2s^2, \\\\ (x+p) &= 2t^2. \\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe last two equations imply $(t^2 - s^2) = p$ solving which we get $t = (p+1)/2$ and $s = (p-1)/2$.

Thus there are no solutions in case $p \\nmid y$.\n\nCase $p \\mid y$. We first note that if $y=0$ then $x=0, p$ or $-p$, and this gives us three solutions. Now, assume that $y \\neq 0$. Since $p \\mid y$ it follows that $(x-p,x,x+p) = p$. Thus, $p^2 \\mid y$. Canceling $p^3$ from both the sides, we have\n\n$$\npb^2 = (a-1)(a)(a+1),\n$$\n\nwhere $a = x/p$ and $b = y/p^2$. Note that $a-1, a$ and $a+1$ are all positive since $y \\neq 0$. Now, $p$ divides exactly one of $(a-1), a$ and $(a+1)$. If $p$ divides $(a-1)$ then, $a$ and $(a+1)$ have to be squares, which is not possible since $a \\neq 0$. So, $p \\nmid (a-1)$. Similarly, $p \\nmid (a+1)$. Thus, it should be the case that $p \\mid a$.\n\nIf $a \\neq 0$ is even, then $(a-1), a/p$ and $(a+1)$ are relatively prime to each other, so they all have to be squares. But it is not possible that $(a-1)$ and $(a+1)$ are both squares. Thus, $a$ should be odd.\n\nNow, $(a-1, a+1) = 2$, so $(a-1) = 2r^2$ and $(a+1) = 2s^2$. This gives $s^2 - r^2 = 1$ which implies $s=1$ and $r=0$. This gives $a=1$ which is not divisible by $p$. Thus there are no solutions in this case.",

Putting this in (1), we get $2xy = 0$ for all $x, y$. This contradiction shows that there are no solutions with $f(0) = 2$. Thus $f(0) = 0$.\n\nPutting $x = y = 1$ in (1), we have $f(2) + f(1)^2 = 5f(1)$. Similarly, $x = y = 2$ gives $f(2)^2 = 6f(2)$. If we take $f(2) = 0$, then $f(1) = 0$ or 5.

Here we change $x$ to $2x$ to get\n\n$$\nf(2x)^2 - f(4x^2) = 4xf(2x) + f(2x) + 10x.\n$$\n\nUsing (4) repeatedly, this simplifies to $12xf(2x) = 0$ for all $x$.

In this case $T(0,0) = \\{\\emptyset\\}$ and $|T(0,0)| = 1$, which agrees with the formula.\n\nAssume $p \\ge r \\ge 1$. Add two two dummy vertices 0, $n+1$ to $P$ such that 0 is joined to 1 and $n$ is joined to $n+1$. Let\n\n$$\n\\Pi = (l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2, \\dots, l_k, m_k, l_{k+1})\n$$\nbe an ordered $(2k+1)$-tuple of positive integers such that\n\n$$\nl_1 + m_1 + l_2 + m_2 + \\cdots + l_k + m_k + l_{k+1} = n + 2. \\quad (*)\n$$\n\n(Thus $\\Pi$ is an ordered partition of $n+2$ into $2k+1$ parts.) We obtain a subset $A = A(\\Pi)$ of $V$ from this as follows: starting from the left end of the sequence $\\langle 0, 1, 2, \\dots, n+1 \\rangle$, we omit the first $l_1$ numbers; choose the next $m_1$ numbers; omit the next $l_2$ numbers; choose the next $m_2$ numbers and so on alternately. Finally, we omit the last $l_{k+1}$ numbers. (Observe, that $l_1 \\ge 1$ and $l_{k+1} \\ge 1$ implies that the dummy vertices $0$ and $n+1$ are not used at all.) The union of $k$ chosen sets of numbers consisting of $m_1, m_2, \\dots, m_k$ elements respectively is defined as $A$. We see that $A \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, n\\}$. Conversely, any $A \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, n\\}$ gives rise to an ordered $2k+1$ tuple of positive integers in a unique way; since $0 \\notin A$ and $n+1 \\notin A$, we have $l_1 \\ge 1$ and $l_{n+1} \\ge 1$. Since the $l$'s are positive, we see that $G(A)$ has $k$ components of vertex sizes $m_1, m_2, \\dots, m_k$. If $u$ of these $k$ numbers, say, $m_{i_1}, m_{i_2}, \\dots, m_{i_u}$ are odd and the remaining $v$ numbers, say, $m_{j_1}, m_{j_2}, \\dots, m_{j_v}$ are even, $0 \\le u, v \\le k$, then $u+v=k$, and $O(G(A)) = u$. Thus $\\mu(A) = m_1 + m_2 + \\cdots + m_k + u$. We count $A$ for which $\\mu(A) = 2r$, $1 \\le r \\le n$. Let $m_{i_1}, m_{i_2}, \\dots, m_{i_u}$ be respectively equal to $2m'_{i_1} - 1, 2m'_{i_2} - 1, \\dots, 2m'_{i_u} - 1$ and $m_{j_1}, m_{j_2}, \\dots, m_{j_v}$ be equal to $2m'_{j_1}, 2m'_{j_2}, \\dots, 2m'_{j_v}$.

          "latex": "(Rijul Saini) Let the circum-circle of BCD be $\\Gamma$ and let the circle with diameter OD be $\\Gamma'$. Let the mid-point of OD be $O'$ (which is also the centre of $\\Gamma'$). Now $OO'$ pass through D and hence $\\Gamma'$ and $\\Gamma$ are tangent to each other at D. Hence there is a homothety with centre D taking $\\Gamma'$ to $\\Gamma$, with ratio 2. Since $\\angle OMD = 90^\\circ$, the point M is on $\\Gamma'$. Let the image of M under the homothety be $D'$; it lies on $\\Gamma$ and M is the midpoint of $DD'$.\n\nConsider the half-turn centred at M taking D to $D'$. This also takes C to E as M is the mid-point of CE. Let $B'$ be the image of B under this transformation. Since the half turn takes a line to another line parallel to it, the image of BC is $B'E$; and $BC \\parallel B'E$. Thus $AE \\parallel BC \\parallel B'E$. It follows that A, $B'$, E are collinear. Observe that A, B lie on the same side of CE. Since we have performed a rigid transformation preserving C, E, the images of A, B must also lie on the same side of CE. This implies that A and $B'$ lie on different side of CE. Thus E lies between A and $B'$. Because of this, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nAB' = AE + EB' &= AE + BC \\quad (\\text{half-turn takes } BC \\text{ to } B'E) \\\\\n&= AB.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe also observe that the half-turn takes triangle CD'B to EDB'. Therefore $\\angle CD'B = \\angle EDB'$. Thus we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\angle BDB' = \\angle BDE + \\angle EDB' &= \\angle BDE + \\angle CD'B = \\angle BDE + \\angle CDB \\\\\n&= \\angle CDE = \\angle CBA = 180^\\circ - \\angle BAB',\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nsince $BC \\parallel AE$. This shows that B, D, $B'$, A are concyclic. Since $AB = AB'$, they subtend equal angle at D. Thus $\\angle ADB' = \\angle BDA'$. Thus\n\n$$\n2\\angle BDA = \\angle BDA + \\angle ADB' = \\angle BDA + \\angle ADE + \\angle EDB'.\n$$\n\nBut observe $\\angle EDB' = \\angle CD'B = \\angle CDB$. Using this we obtain\n\n$$\n2\\angle BDA = \\angle BDA + \\angle ADE + \\angle CDB = \\angle CDE.\n$$\n\nThis completes the proof.",

This gives either $a = b$ or $ab(a + b) = c^3$. Similarly, $b = c$ or $bc(b + c) = a^3$. If $a \\neq b$ and $b \\neq c$, we obtain\n\n$$\nab(a + b) = c^3, \\quad bc(b + c) = a^3.\n$$\n\nTherefore\n\n$$\nb(a^2 - c^2) + b^2(a - c) = c^3 - a^3.\n$$\n\nThis gives $(a-c)(a^2+b^2+c^2+ab+bc+ca) = 0$. Since $a, b, c$ are positive, the only possibility is $a=c$. We have therefore 4 possibilities: $a=b=c$; $a \\neq b, b \\neq c$ and $c=a$; $b \\neq c, c \\neq a$ and $a=b$; $c \\neq a, a \\neq b$ and $b=c$.\n\nSuppose $a=b$ and $b, a \\neq c$. Then $b(c^3 + a^3) = c(a^3 + b^3)$ gives $ac^3 + a^4 = 2ca^3$. This implies that $a(a-c)(a^2-ac-c^2) = 0$. Therefore $a^2-ac-c^2 = 0$. Putting $a/c = x$, we get the quadratic equation $x^2 - x - 1 = 0$. Hence $x = (1+\\sqrt{5})/2$. Thus we get\n\n$$\na = b = \\left( \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\right) c, \\quad c \\text{ arbitrary positive real number.}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, we get other two cases:\n\n$$\nb = c = \\left( \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\right) a, \\quad a \\text{ arbitrary positive real number;}\n$$\n\n$$\nc = a = \\left( \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\right) b, \\quad b \\text{ arbitrary positive real number.}\n$$\n\nAnd $a = b = c$ is the fourth possibility.\n\nConsider (II): $a(a^3 + b^3) = b(b^3 + c^3) = c(c^3 + a^3)$. Suppose $a, b, c$ are mutually distinct. We may assume $a = \\max\\{a, b, c\\}$. Hence $a > b$ and $a > c$. Using $a > b$, we get from the first relation that $a^3 + b^3 < b^3 + c^3$. Therefore $a^3 < c^3$ forcing $a < c$. This contradicts $a > c$. We conclude that $a, b, c$ cannot be mutually distinct. This means some two must be equal. If $a = b$, the equality of the first two expressions give $a^3 + b^3 = b^3 + c^3$ so that $a = c$. Similarly, we can show that $b = c$ implies $b = a$ and $c = a$ gives $c = b$.\n\nAlternate for (II) by a contestant: We can write\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} \\frac{a^3}{c} + \\frac{b^3}{c} &= \\frac{c^3}{a} + a^2, \\\\ \\frac{b^3}{a} + \\frac{c^3}{a} &= \\frac{a^3}{b} + b^2, \\\\ \\frac{c^3}{b} + \\frac{a^3}{b} &= \\frac{b^3}{c} + c^2. \\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAdding, we get\n\n$$\n\\frac{a^3}{c} + \\frac{b^3}{a} + \\frac{c^3}{b} = a^2 + b^2 + c^2.\n$$\n\nUsing C-S inequality, we have\n\n$$\n(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2 = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{a^3}}{\\sqrt{c}} \\cdot \\sqrt{ac} + \\frac{\\sqrt{b^3}}{\\sqrt{a}} \\cdot \\sqrt{ba} + \\frac{\\sqrt{c^3}}{\\sqrt{b}} \\cdot \\sqrt{cb} \\right)^2 \\\\ \\le \\left( \\frac{a^3}{c} + \\frac{b^3}{a} + \\frac{c^3}{b} \\right) (ac + ba + cb) \\\\ = (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)(ab + bc + ca).\n$$\n\nThus we obtain\n\n$$\na^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\le ab + bc + ca.\n$$\n\nHowever this implies $(a-b)^2 + (b-c)^2 + (c-a)^2 \\le 0$ and hence $a=b=c$.",

Hence we obtain $2pa + p^2d = l - k$. Similarly, we get $2qa + q^2d = m - k$. Observe that $p^2q - pq^2 \\neq 0$. Otherwise $p = q$ and $\\text{gcd}(p, q) = p > 1$ which is a contradiction to the given hypothesis that $\\text{gcd}(p, q) = 1$. Hence we can solve the two equations for $a, d$:\n\n$$\na = \\frac{p^2(m-k) - q^2(l-k)}{2(p^2q - pq^2)}, \\quad d = \\frac{q(l-k) - p(m-k)}{p^2q - pq^2}.\n$$\n\nIt follows that $a, d$ are rational numbers. We also have\n\n$$\np^2a^2 = p^2a + kp^2d.\n$$\n\nBut $p^2d = l - k - 2pa$. Thus we get\n\n$$\np^2a^2 = p^2a + k(l - k - 2pa) = (p - 2k)pa + k(l - k).\n$$\n\nThis shows that $pa$ satisfies the equation\n\n$$\nx^2 - (p - 2k)x - k(l - k) = 0.\n$$\n\nSince $a$ is rational, we see that $pa$ is rational. Write $pa = w/z$, where $w$ is an integer and $z$ is a natural number such that $\\text{gcd}(w, z) = 1$. Substituting in the equation, we obtain\n\n$$\nw^2 - (p - 2k)wz - k(l - k)z^2 = 0.\n$$\n\nThis shows $z$ divides $w$. Since $\\text{gcd}(w, z) = 1$, it follows that $z = 1$ and $pa = w$ an integer. (In fact any rational solution of a monic polynomial with integer coefficients is necessarily an integer.) Similarly, we can prove that $qa$ is an integer. Since $\\text{gcd}(p, q) = 1$, there are integers $u$ and $v$ such that $pu + qv = 1$. Therefore $a = (pa)u + (qa)v$. It follows that $a$ is an integer.\n\nBut $p^2d = l - k - 2pa$. Hence $p^2d$ is an integer. Similarly, $q^2d$ is also an integer. Since $\\text{gcd}(p^2, q^2) = 1$, it follows that $d$ is an integer. Combining these two, we see that all the terms of the AP are integers.\n\n**Alternatively,** we can prove that $a$ and $d$ are integers in another way. We have seen that $a$ and $d$ are rationals; and we have three relations:\n\n$$\na^2 = a + kd, \\quad p^2d + 2pa = n_1, \\quad q^2d + 2qa = n_2,\n$$\n\nwhere $n_1 = l - k$ and $n_2 = m - k$. Let $a = u/v$ and $d = x/y$ where $u, x$ are integers and $v, y$ are natural numbers, and $\\text{gcd}(u, v) = 1$, $\\text{gcd}(x, y) = 1$. Putting this in these relations, we obtain\n\n$$\nu^2y = uvy + kxv^2, \\quad (1)\n$$\n\n$$\n2puy + p^2vx = vyn_1, \\quad (2)\n$$\n\n$$\n2quy + q^2vx = vyn_2. \\quad (3)\n$$\n\nNow (1) shows that $v|u^2y$. Since $\\gcd(u, v) = 1$, it follows that $v|y$. Similarly (2) shows that $y|p^2vx$. Using $\\gcd(y, x) = 1$, we get that $y|p^2v$. Similarly, (3) shows that $y|q^2v$. Therefore $y$ divides $\\gcd(p^2v, q^2v) = v$. The two results $v|y$ and $y|v$ imply $v = y$, since both $v, y$ are positive.\n\nSubstitute this in (1) to get\n\n$$\nu^2 = uv + kxv.\n$$\n\nThis shows that $v|u^2$. Since $\\gcd(u, v) = 1$, it follows that $v = 1$. This gives $v = y = 1$. Finally $a = u$ and $d = x$ which are integers.",

Here $n$ can be odd or even. If $n$ is even, it can be either of the form $4d+2$ or of the form $4d$.\n\nIf $n$ is odd, then $1 = T^k(n) = T^{k-1}(n+1)$. (Observe that $k > 1$; otherwise we get $n+1 = 1$ which is impossible since $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.) Here $n+1$ is even.\n\nIf $n = 4d + 2$, then again $1 = T^k(4d + 2) = T^{k-1}(2d + 1)$. Here $2d + 1 = n/2$ is odd.\n\nThus each solution of $T^{k-1}(m) = 1$ produces exactly one solution of $T^k(n) = 1$ and $n$ is either odd or of the form $4d + 2$.\n\nIf $n = 4d$, we see that $1 = T^k(4d) = T^{k-1}(2d) = T^{k-2}(d)$. This shows that each solution of $T^{k-2}(m) = 1$ produces exactly one solution of $T^k(n) = 1$ of the form $4d$.\n\nThus the number of solutions of $T^k(n) = 1$ is equal to the number of solutions of $T^{k-1}(m) = 1$ and the number of solutions of $T^{k-2}(l) = 1$ for $k > 2$. This shows that $c_k = c_{k-1} + c_{k-2}$ for $k > 2$. We also observe that 2 is the only number which goes to 1 in one step and 4 is the only number which goes to 1 in two steps. Hence $c_1 = 1$ and $c_2 = 2$. This proves that $c_n = f_{n+1}$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.",

Let $a = u/v$ and $d = x/y$ where $u, x$ are integers and $v, y$ are natural numbers, and $\\text{gcd}(u, v) = 1$, $\\text{gcd}(x, y) = 1$. Putting this in these relations, we obtain\n\n$$\nu^2 y = uvy + kxv^2, \\qquad (1)\n$$\n\n$$\n2puy + p^2vx = vyn_1, \\qquad (2)\n$$\n\n$$\n2quy + q^2vx = vyn_2. \\qquad (3)\n$$\n\nNow (1) shows that $v|u^2y$. Since $\\text{gcd}(u, v) = 1$, it follows that $v|y$. Similarly (2) shows that $y|p^2vx$. Using $\\text{gcd}(y, x) = 1$, we get that $y|p^2v$. Similarly, (3) shows that $y|q^2v$. Therefore $y$ divides $\\text{gcd}(p^2v, q^2v) = v$. The two results $v|y$ and $y|v$ imply $v = y$, since both $v, y$ are positive. Substitute this in (1) to get\n\n$$\nu^2 = uv + kxv.\n$$\n\nThis shows that $v|u^2$. Since $\\text{gcd}(u, v) = 1$, it follows that $v = 1$. This gives $v = y = 1$. Finally $a = u$ and $d = x$ which are integers.",

For $i > 0$, we let\n\n$$\n(r_i, s_i, t_i) = \\begin{cases} (2r_{i-1}, 2s_{i-1}, 2t_{i-1} + 1) & \\text{if } a_{i-1} < b_{i-1}, \\\\ (2r_{i-1} - 1, 2s_{i-1} - 1, 2t_{i-1} - 1) & \\text{if } a_{i-1} > b_{i-1}, \\\\ (r_{i-1}, s_{i-1}, t_{i-1}) & \\text{if } a_{i-1} = b_{i-1}. \\end{cases}\n$$\n\nIt is then easy to verify that $a_i = r_i a_0 + s_i b_0 + t_i$ and $b_i = (1-r_i)a_0 + (1-s_i)b_0 - t_i$ for all $i \\ge 0$.\n\nNow let $k$ be the smallest non-negative integer such that $a_k = b_k$. For any integer $l$ with $0 \\le l \\le k$ we claim that $r_l - s_l = t_l + 1 - 2s_l = 2^l$. We prove this claim by induction on $l$. The claim is straightforward to check for $l = 0$. Now, suppose that the claim is true for some non-negative integer $l < k$. Since $l + 1 \\le k$ it follows that $(r_{l+1}, s_{l+1}, t_{l+1})$ equals either $(2r_l, 2s_l, 2t_l + 1)$ or $(2r_l - 1, 2s_l - 1, 2t_l - 1)$. In either case, $r_{l+1} - s_{l+1} = 2(r_l - s_l)$ and $t_{l+1} + 1 - 2s_{l+1} = 2(t_l + 1 - 2s_l)$. Hence the claim.\n\nNow if $a_k = b_k$ then $r_k a_0 + s_k b_0 + t_k = (1-r_k)a_0 + (1-s_k)b_0 - t_k$. This implies $(2r_k - 1) + 2t_k = (1-2s_k)n$. Therefore $(n+3)(1-2s_k) = 2(r_k - s_k) + 2t_k - 4s_k + 2 = 2^{k+2}$. Hence $n+3$ is a power of 2. In fact, since $1-2s_k$ is also a power of 2, it follows that $s_k = 0$ and hence $n+3 = 2^{k+2}$.",

Each of the sets $R_i = \\{R_1, R_2, \\dots, R_n\\}$ and $C_i = \\{C_1, C_2, \\dots, C_n\\}$ are independent sets. For every $i, j \\in \\mathbb{N}_n$, $R_i, C_j$ are connected by an edge if and only if $a_{ij} > 0$, where $a_{ij}$ is the entry of $A_0$ in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column. Observe that from our definition, $\\mathcal{G}$ is a bipartite graph.\n\nConsider some $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$. By $N(S)$, we will denote the set of vertices which are adjacent to some vertex in $S$. We will show that $|N(S)| \\ge |S|$.\nFor every edge having an endpoint in $S$, label that edge with $a_{ij}$. Consider the 'sum' of all such edges. Clearly, for each $R_i \\in S$, the edges incident with $R_i$ contribute $m$ to this total. Hence, the total sum is given by $m|S|$. Now these are edges are a subset of all edges with an endpoint in $N(S)$. Hence, if we consider a similar such sum for the set $N(S)$, we get the sum to be $m|N(S)|$. As observed before, we see that $m|S| \\le m|N(S)|$. Hence, we get that $|N(S)| \\ge |S|$. Since $S$ was any arbitrary subset of $\\mathbb{R}$, we that this is true for all subsets of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nSince the hypothesis for Hall's Matching Theorem is satisfied, an application of it implies that there exists a matching in the above bipartite graph $\\mathcal{G}$. Since $|\\mathbb{R}| = |\\mathbb{C}| = n$, we see that the matching is nothing but a bijective function $\\sigma: \\mathbb{N}_n \\to \\mathbb{N}_n$ where $\\sigma(i)$ is defined to be the index of the element in $\\mathbb{C}$ which is matched with $R_i$. Note that $\\sigma$ can also be thought of as a permutation of $\\mathbb{N}_n$. We also know that $R_i \\cap C_j = \\{a_{ij}\\}, \\forall i, j \\in \\mathbb{N}_n$. Since $\\sigma$ is a matching, we know that $a_{i\\sigma(i)} > 0$ for all $i \\in \\mathbb{N}_n$. Consider the permutation matrix $P_\\sigma$ where each entry $p_{ij}$ is given by\n\n$$\np_{ij} = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } j = \\sigma(i) \\\\ 0 & \\text{if otherwise.} \\end{cases} \\quad \\forall i, j \\in \\mathbb{N}_n\n$$\n\nAlso consider the matrix $A_1 = A_0 - P_\\sigma$. Note that since $a_{i\\sigma(i)} > 0, \\forall i \\in \\mathbb{N}_n$, every entry of $A_1$ is non-negative. Also observe that since $P_\\sigma$ is a permutation matrix, the sum of entries in each row and each column reduces by 1. In effect, $A_1$ is still an $n$-magic square with common sum $k-1$. This completes the inductive step. Hence by Induction, we see that the statement $P(m)$ is true for all $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$. The proof is now complete.",

Then $\\alpha = (q(x) - r(x))(q(x) + r(x))$. Clearly, either $q(x) - r(x)$ or $q(x) + r(x)$ is not a constant polynomial, and hence a contradiction. This proves the lemma.\n\n\\textbf{Continuation of the solution:} We can write $f(x)$ as $f_1(x)^2(x - \\alpha_1)(x - \\alpha_2) \\cdots (x - \\alpha_k)$, where $f_1(x)$ is a polynomial and $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\cdots, \\alpha_k$ are distinct complex numbers.

Then $h(\\beta) = 0$ and hence $h(x) = (x - \\beta)h_1(x)$. Note that $g(\\beta) - \\alpha_i = 0$ for any $i = 1$. Therefore it follows that $(x - \\beta)^2$ divides $g(x) - \\alpha_1$. We can then conclude that $g(x) - \\alpha_1$ is a square. Similarly, $g(x) - \\alpha_i$ is a square for $i = 1, 2, \\cdots, k$. By the above lemma, it follows that $k = 1$, so $f(x) = f_1(x)^2(x - \\alpha)$ and $g(x) = g_1(x)^2 + \\alpha$ for some non-zero complex number $\\alpha$.

These $N-1$ drones cover all roads in Sibyl.\n\nFor $N = 2n + 1$, again make one drone go across the boundary, and let $n$ of the drones traverse the rectangles enclosed by $v_{2i}, v_{2i+1}, h_1, h_N$ for all $1 \\le i \\le n$, and let $n$ of the drones traverse the rectangles enclosed by $h_{2i}, h_{2i+1}, v_1, v_N$ for all $1 \\le i \\le n$. One notes that these $N$ drones cover all roads in Sibyl.\n\n\\textbf{Estimate:} Suppose $k$ drones suffice. We will first show for all $N$ that $k \\ge N-1$. Fix the top-left corner $A$ of the grid and call any drone that passes through this town to be \\textit{cornered}. Suppose $C$ is the set of drones that are cornered. Let $\\mathcal{L}_h, \\mathcal{L}_v$ denote the set of drones (not in $C$) that cross a street in $h_1, v_1$ respectively. Note that any drone that covers some vertex in $h_1$ is either in $C$ or $\\mathcal{L}_h$ and any drone in $\\mathcal{L}_h$ covers two vertices in $h_1$ and any drone in $C$ covers one vertex in $h_1$ other than $A$. Since each of the $N$ vertices on the top edge needs to be covered, $1 + |C| + 2|\\mathcal{L}_h| \\ge N$. Similarly, $1 + |C| + 2|\\mathcal{L}_v| \\ge N$. Adding, we get $2 + 2|C| + 2|\\mathcal{L}_h| + 2|\\mathcal{L}_v| \\ge 2N$, hence $k \\ge |C| + |\\mathcal{L}_h| + |\\mathcal{L}_v| \\ge N-1$, proving the claim.\n\nNow suppose $N$ is odd. If possible, suppose $k = N-1$. Following the notation in the last part, we see that equality must hold: $1 + |C| + 2|\\mathcal{L}_h| = N$ and $1 + |C| + 2|\\mathcal{L}_v| = N$. Further, every drone must be in one of these three sets, and no point on the top edge apart from the top-left corner can be covered by two drones (else the bounds would not be tight).\n\nCall a drone a \\textit{dominator} if it passes through both $h_1, h_N$ (a vertical dominator) or both $v_1, v_N$ (a horizontal dominator). Since every drone passes through either $h_1$ or $v_1$, and this reasoning applies any other corner, this implies that every drone must be a dominator. Indeed, if some drone is not a dominator, one can pick one of $h_1, h_N$ and one of $v_1, v_N$ so that it doesn't pass through any of the picked lines; and applying the above reasoning to the corner at the intersection of these two leads to a contradiction.\n\nNow if there are two horizontal dominators through $A$, they both cover the top-right corner, contradiction. Similarly, there can be at most at most one vertical dominator through $A$. But $|C|$ is at least one (some drone needs to cover $A$), and $|C| = 1$ leads to a contradiction modulo 2 in $1 + |C| + 2|\\mathcal{L}_h| = N$, so $|C|$ is exactly 2, and there is a horizontal and a vertical dominator through $A$.\n\nBy a similar reasoning, there is a vertical and a horizontal dominator through the bottom-right corner, $D$. But the horizontal dominator through $A$ and the vertical dominator through $D$ both cover the top-right corner point. We noted before that no point on the top edge apart from the top-left corner can be covered by two drones, so this is a contradiction, showing $k \\ge N$. $\\square$",

To that end, note that in a $k$-pop sequence, since the set $\\{a_1, \\dots, a_{n+k+1}\\}$ has either the same number of distinct elements as $\\{a_1, \\dots, a_{n+k}\\}$ or precisely one more, it follows that $a_{n+1}$ is either $a_n$ or $a_n+1$ for each $n$. A sequence $\\langle b_n \\rangle_{n=1}^\\infty$ with the property that $b_{n+1} \\in \\{b_n, b_n+1\\}$ for each $n$ will be called a step-sequence, and an index $n$ such that $b_{n+1} = b_n+1$ will be called a step. Now we characterize $k$-pop sequences:\n\n\\textbf{Lemma} A sequence $\\langle a_n \\rangle_{n=1}^\\infty$ is $k$-pop if and only if it is a step-sequence and the following hold:\n\n1. for each $n$, the index $n$ is a step if and only if $n + k$ is, and\n2. the number of steps among $\\{1, \\dots, k\\}$ is equal to $a_1 - 1$.\n\n\\textit{Proof.} Assume $\\langle a_n \\rangle_{n=1}^\\infty$ is $k$-pop. As seen before, it is a step-sequence. Now if $n$ is a step if and only if the number of distinct elements in $\\{a_1, \\dots, a_{n+k+1}\\}$ is one more than that in $\\{a_1, \\dots, a_{n+k}\\}$, which is possible if and only $a_{n+k+1}$ is not an element of $\\{a_1, \\dots, a_{n+k}\\}$. Since $\\langle a_n \\rangle_{n=1}^\\infty$ is a step-sequence, this happens if and only if $a_{n+k+1} = a_{n+k} + 1$, i.e., $n+k$ is a step. Now $a_1$ is equal to the number of distinct elements in $\\{a_1, \\dots, a_{k+1}\\}$, which is obviously one more than the number of steps in $\\{1, \\dots, k\\}$. This proves one direction of the implication.\n\nNow assume $\\langle a_n \\rangle_{n=1}^\\infty$ is a step-sequence satisfying the two conditions. We will show by induction that $a_n$ is equal to the number of distinct elements in the set $\\{a_1, \\dots, a_{n+k}\\}$.\n\nThe base case $n=1$ follows from condition (2): since it is a step-sequence, the number of distinct elements in $\\{a_1, \\dots, a_{k+1}\\}$ is one more than the number of steps in $\\{1, \\dots, k\\}$, and thus equal to $a_1$. Now for a general $m=n+1$, note that the number of distinct elements in $\\{a_1, \\dots, a_{n+k+1}\\}$ is equal to the number of distinct elements in $\\{a_1, \\dots, a_{n+k}\\}$ if $a_{n+k+1} = a_{n+k}$, and one more than that otherwise. In the first case, $n+k$ is not a step, therefore, neither is $n$, so $a_{n+1} = a_n$, which is equal to the number of distinct elements in either of those sets. The other case is similar.\n\nThis shows our sequence is $k$-pop. $\\square$\n\nThus to determine a $k$-pop sequence, it suffices to determine which of the indices in $\\{1, \\dots, k\\}$ are steps: by condition (1), this determines the locations of all steps, and by condition (2), this fixes $a_1$. Once these are fixed, $a_n$ can be determined inductively. Conversely, any such selection of indices gives rise to a step-sequence satisfying the conditions in the lemma by the aforementioned recipe, and thus a $k$-pop sequence. There are exactly $2^k$ ways to choose the steps, which is therefore the answer. $\\square$",

Given that every vertex in $G$ admits at least one antitour, and that $G$ has a Hamiltonian path, find the least possible number of antitours from some vertex of $G$.\n\nLet $N = 50$; we claim that the answer is $((N/2)!)^2$.\n\n**Bound.** Observe that if $V$ can be reached by a walk of length $d$, then it can be reached by a walk of length $d + 2k$ for any non-negative integer $k$, simply by going to $V$ and then going back-and-forth on some adjacent edge $k$ times.\n\n**Claim 1** The graph is bipartite.\n\n*Proof.* Indeed, suppose there is some odd cycle $A_0, A_1, \\dots, A_{2i}$. Consider an antitour $C_1, \\dots, C_N$ from $A_0$. Note that for $1 \\le k \\le 2i$, $A_k$ can be reached from $A_0$ by $k$ moves (and thus in $k+2j$ moves) and also in $2i+1-k$ (and thus in $2i+1-k+2j$ moves). Now any integer $n \\ge 2i$ can be written as either $k+2j$ (if $n \\equiv k \\pmod 2$) or as $2i+1-k+2j$ (if $n \\not\\equiv k \\pmod 2$), so none of the $A_k$'s can be $C_n$ for $n \\ge 2i$. Thus the vertices $A_1, \\dots, A_{2i}$ must be $C_1, \\dots, C_{2i-1}$ in some order, which is impossible. $\\square$\n\n*Proof.* Alternately, one can also argue the initial part as is and then since the distance of any vertex not in the cycle is at most $N - (2i+1)$. Now, from any vertex $A_j$ in the cycle, consider an anti-tour. Let the $N$th in this anti-tour be $V_j$. Now, the distance of $V_j$ to the cycle is at most $N - (2i+1)$ and there is a path of length $\\le 2i+1$ from $A_j$ to the vertex to which $V_j$ has the shortest path in the cycle with odd or even number of steps. Thus, there is an even and an odd path from $A_j$ to $V_j$ in $\\le N$ moves. This is clearly a contradiction! $\\square$\n\nSince the Hamiltonian path must contain an equal number of vertices from each part, the parts have $N/2$ vertices each. If the capital is in part $A = \\{A_1, \\dots, A_{N/2}\\}$, and the other part is $B = \\{B_1, \\dots, B_{N/2}\\}$, then one can form an antitour by putting the $A_i$'s in the odd positions in any order and $B_i$'s in the even positions in any order. There are $((N/2)!)^2$ ways to do this, which proves our bound.\n\n**Construction.** Consider the complete bipartite graph $K_{N/2,N/2}$, with parts $\\{A_1, \\dots, A_{N/2}\\}$ and $\\{B_1, \\dots, B_{N/2}\\}$. Any antitour from $A_1$ must have all the $B_i$'s in the even positions since any $B_i$ is reachable in 1 move (and thus in any odd number of moves). Thus there are at most $((N/2)!)^2$ antitours for this. $\\square$\n\nWe can have alternate constructions. For example: Let $A_1, \\dots, A_{50}$ be the Hamiltonian path, with $A_1$ capital.

Now, assume $f(x) = f(y)$. Choose $m = x^{2023}$ and $n = y^{2023}$. Thus, $f^m(x) = x$ and $f^n(y) = y$, and note that\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*} \nf(x) = f(y) &\\implies f^{mn-1}(f(x)) = f^{mn-1}(f(y)) \\\n&\\implies (f^m)^n(x) = (f^n)^m(y) \\\n&\\implies x = y \n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHence, $f$ is injective, and therefore, $f$ is bijective too.\n\nThere are various variations of proofs of this claim but this seems the simplest to us.\n\n\\textbf{Claim 1} $f^a(x) = f^b(x) = x \\implies f^{\\gcd(a,b)}(x) = x$.\n\n\\textit{Proof.} Let $d$ be the smallest positive integer such that $f^d(x) = x$. By Euclidean algorithm, $d \\mid a$ and $d \\mid b$. Therefore $d \\mid \\gcd(a, b)$, and so $f^{\\gcd(a,b)}(x) = x$. $\\square$\n\nWe present two class of proofs. Class \\textbf{A} proceeds by induction on the number of divisors of $x$ and shows that $f(x) = g(x) = x$ for those $x$. Class \\textbf{B} uses induction to prove that $x|g(x)$ for all $x$ and finishes directly from there.\n\n\\textbf{Solution A.}\n\nThis is an induction argument on number of divisors of $x$ to prove $f(x) = x$.\n\n\\textbf{Solution A1.}\n\n\\textbf{Claim 2} $f = g$\n\n\\textit{Proof.} We prove that $f(g^{-1}(n)) = g(g^{-1}(n)) = n$ for all $n$ by induction.\n\nFor the base case, consider $x = y = g^{-1}(1)$. Now, $f(x) \\mid g(x) = 1 \\implies f(x) = g(x) = 1$. Now, assume that we proved the result for all $n \\le k-1$ for $k > 1$. Then, letting $x = y = g^{-1}(k)$, we get $f(x) \\le g(x) = k$. But then $f(x) \\le k$ and $f, g$ are bijective, so if $f(x) < k$, then we have\n\n\\[\nf(g^{-1}(f(x))) = f(x) \\implies x = g^{-1}(f(x)) \\implies g(x) = f(x) \\implies f(x) = k\n\\]\n\nThis is clearly a contradiction. Thus, $f(x) = k$.\n\nThus, our inductive argument gives us that $f(x) = g(x)$ for all $x$ as $g^{-1}(n)$ eventually takes all values as $g$ is bijective.\n\nThus, $f = g$.\n\nOur condition becomes $x \\mid y \\implies f(x) \\mid f(y)$.\n\n\\textbf{Claim 3} For every $x, y, n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $x | y \\implies f^n(x) | f^n(y)$\n\n\\textit{Proof.} This follows by using the second condition repeatedly. $\\Box$\n\n\\textbf{Claim 4} For every $x, y \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $x | y \\Longleftrightarrow f(x) | f(y)$.\n\n\\textit{Proof.} It suffices to prove $f(x) | f(y) \\implies x | y$. To this end, suppose $f^m(x) = x$ and $f^n(y) = y$. Using the previous claim, we have\n\n\\[\nf(x) | f(y) \\implies f^{mn-1}(f(x)) | f^{mn-1}(f(y)) \\implies (f^m)^n(x) | (f^n)^m(y) \\implies x | y,\n\\]\n\nas claimed.\n\nDefine $d(x)$ to be the number of positive divisors of $x$.\n\n\\textbf{Claim 5} For all $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $d(x) = d(f(x))$.\n\n\\textit{Proof.} For any given $x$, let $A$ and $B$ be the sets of positive divisors of $x$ and $f(x)$ respectively. Clearly, by Claim 4 and bijectivity, $f$, when restricted to $A$, is a bijection from $A$ to $B$, whence the claim follows. $\\Box$\n\n\\textbf{Claim 6} For any given $n$, let its prime factorisation be $n = p_1^{a_1} \\cdot p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_j^{a_j}$. Then,\n\n\\[\nf(n) = f(p_1)^{a_1} \\cdot f(p_2)^{a_2} \\cdots f(p_j)^{a_j}\n\\]\n\nwhere all $f(p_i)$'s are distinct primes.\n\n\\textit{Proof.} We will prove this by strong induction on $\\sum a_i$. For $n = 1$, $\\sum a_k = 0$. Also, $d(1) = 1 = d(f(1))$. But 1 is the only natural number with only 1 divisor. So $f(1)$ is 1.\n\nNow, if $n$ is a prime, then $d(n) = 2 = d(f(n))$, so $f(n)$ is also prime. Also, it is clear that no two $f(p_i)$'s can be equal as $f$ is bijective.\n\nNow, let's assume that the above statement is true for all $n$ such that $\\sum a_i < k$. For $n$ with $\\sum a_i = k$, and $k \\ge 2$, let $A$ (resp. $B$) be the set of positive divisors of $n$ (resp. $f(n)$). Clearly, by Claim 4, $f$, when restricted to $A$, is a bijection from $A$ to $B$. Since all elements of $A$ are divisors of $n$, all elements of $A$, except $n$ itself, have $\\sum a_i < k$, so the stated claim is true all of them.\n\nNow, if $n$ is a prime power, say $p^k$, then since $A = \\{1, p, p^2 \\dots p^k\\}$ (as $f(p)$ is prime), $B$ must be $\\{1, f(p), f(p)^2 \\dots f(p)^{k-1}, f(n)\\}$. But since $B$ is the set of divisors of $f(n)$, the only possible value of $f(n)$ is $f(p)^k$.\n\nNow, if $n$ has multiple prime factors, lets say it's prime factorisation is $n = p_1^{a_1} \\cdot p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_j^{a_j}$. We have\n\n\\[\np_i^{a_i} \\in A, \\forall i \\le j \\implies f(p_i^{a_i}) \\in B, \\forall i \\le j \\implies f(p_i)^{a_i} \\in B, \\forall i \\le j\n\\]\n\nby the induction hypothesis. Therefore $\\prod f(p_i)^{a_i}$ must also be in $B$, since all $f(p_i)$'s are distinct primes. But we know from our induction hypothesis that this is not the image of any of the proper divisors of $n$ under $f$, and $B$ is the image of $A$ under $f$, hence $\\prod f(p_i)^{a_i} = f(n)$ in this case as well. $\\Box$\n\nNow, consider any prime $p$. We know that $f^{p^{2023}}(f(p)) = f(p)$ and $f^{p^{2023}}(f(p)) = f(p) \\implies f^{\\gcd(p^{2023}, f(p)^{2023})}(f(p)) = f(p)$. But $p, f(p)$ are primes, thus $\\gcd$ is 1 unless $p = f(p)$ but if $f^1(f(p)) = f(p)$, then $f(p) = p$.\n\nNow, by multiplicativity of $f$, we get that $f(x) = x$ for all $x$. $\\Box$\n\n\\textbf{Solution A2.}\n\n\\textbf{Claim 2} For all $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $d(x) \\le d(g(x))$.\n\n\\textit{Proof.} $f$ is an injective function from set of divisors of $x$ to set of divisors of $g(x)$. $\\Box$\n\nIf $g(n) = 1$, then $d(g(n)) = 1 \\implies d(n) \\le 1 \\implies d(n) = 1 \\implies g(1) = 1$. Further, $f(1) | g(1) = 1 \\implies f(1) = 1$.\n\n\\textbf{Claim 3} For any prime $p$, $f(p) = g(p) = p$.\n\n\\textit{Proof.} Let $g(q) = p$. Then $d(q) \\le d(p) = 2$ and $q \\ne 1$ by injectivity of $g$, so $q$ is also a prime. Further, $f(q) | g(q) = p$ and $f(q) \\ne 1$ by injectivity $\\implies f(q) = p$. Now,\n\n\\[\nf^{p^{2023}}(q) = f^{p^{2023}-1}(p) = f^{-1}(p) = q = f^{q^{2023}}(q) \\implies f^{\\gcd(p^{2023}, q^{2023})}(q) = q\n\\]\n\nNow, if $p \\ne q$, we get a contradiction. Hence $q = p$, and so $f(q) = g(q) = p$. $\\square$\n\nNow we use strong induction on $d(n)$ to prove $f(n) = g(n) = n$. Bases cases are $d(n) = 1$ and $d(n) = 2$; these are done since $f(1) = g(1) = 1$ and $f(p) = g(p) = p$ for primes $p$.\n\nNow assume the claim is true for all $m$ such that $d(m) \\le k$, for some $k \\ge 2$. Let $n$ satisfy $d(n) = k+1$. Suppose $g(y) = n$. By Claim 2, $d(y) \\le d(n)$. If $d(y) < d(n)$, by induction hypothesis we have $y = g(y) = n$, contradiction! Hence $d(y) = d(n)$. We have two cases:\n\n\\textbf{Case I:} $y$ is not a power of a prime.\n\nLet $y = p_1^{a_1} \\cdot p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_j^{a_j}$. Then each $p_i^{a_i}$ has $a_i + 1 < d(y) = k + 1$ divisors, so $f(p_i^{a_i}) = p_i^{a_i}$. Therefore $p_i^{a_i} | g(y) = n$ for all $i \\implies y | n$. But, we have $d(y) = d(n)$, so $y = n$, and $g(n) = n$.\n\n\\textbf{Case II:} $y = p^a$ for some prime $p$.\n\nSince $d(y) = k+1$, $a = k \\ge 2$. Then $d(p^{k-1}) = k \\implies f(p^{k-1}) = p^{k-1}$ by induction hypothesis $\\implies p^{k-1} | g(y) = n$. If some prime $q \\ne p$ divides $n$, then $p^{k-1}q | n \\implies d(n) \\ge d(p^{k-1}q) = 2k > k + 1$ since $k \\ge 2$, contradiction! Therefore $n = p^b$, and $d(n) = k+1 \\implies n = p^k = y$. Hence $g(n) = n$ in this case as well.\n\nThen $f(n) | g(n) = n$, so $f(n) \\ne n \\implies d(f(n)) < d(n) \\implies f(n) = f(f(n))$ by induction hypothesis $\\implies f(n) = n$ by injectivity, contradiction! Hence $f(n) = g(n) = n$, and we are done by induction.\n\n\\textbf{Solution B.}\n\n\\textbf{Solution B1.}\n\n\\textbf{Claim 2} $f = g$\n\n\\textit{Proof.} Same as Claim 2 in Solution A1. $\\square$\n\n\\textbf{Claim 3} $d(f(x)) = d(x)$.\n\n\\textit{Proof.} $x|y \\implies f(x)|f(y)$ and $f$ is bijective.

By Claim 3, $q$ is also a prime. Now,\n\n\\[\nf^{p^{2023}}(q) = f^{p^{2023}-1}(p) = f^{-1}(p) = q = f^{q^{2023}}(q) \\implies f^{\\gcd(p^{2023}, q^{2023})}(q) = q\n\\]\n\nNow, if $p \\ne q$, we get a contradiction. $\\square$\n\n\\textbf{Claim 5} $f(p^\\alpha) = p^\\alpha$ for $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\n\\textit{Proof.} Let $t = f^{-1}(p^\\alpha)$. Now, if $q$ is a prime such that $q|t$, then $f(q)|p^\\alpha \\implies q|p \\implies p = q$. Thus, $t$ is a power of $p$. Let $t = p^{\\alpha'}$ but by Claim 3, $\\alpha + 1 = \\alpha' + 1 \\implies t = p^\\alpha$. Thus, $f(p^\\alpha) = p^\\alpha$. $\\square$",

Going over all prime divisors of $x$, we get the desired result. $\\square$\n\nNow, we can finish in two ways,\n\n$$\nx | f(x) | f^2(x) | \\dots | f^{x^{2023}}(x) | x \\implies f(x) = x\n$$\n\nThis uses the fact that $f(x)$ is cyclic for all $x$ but this can easily be avoided as well that for a bijective function $f$, we have $f(x) \\ge x$. So consider the smallest $x$ such that $f(x) \\neq x$. Now, clearly $x > f^{-1}(x)$ since for all $x$ lesser than it, $f(x) = x$. This is essentially how we proved that $f = g$. Thus, we are done.\n\nSolution B2\n\nThis solution follows essentially the same chain of arguments that Solution B1 does but it avoids the usage of the claim that $f = g$.\n\nClaim 2 $d(x) \\le d(g(x))$\n\nProof. Same as Claim 2 in Solution A2\n\nClaim 3 $f(p) = p$ for all primes $p$.\n\nProof. Same as Claim 3 in Solution A2\n\nClaim 4 $f(p^\\alpha) = g(p^\\alpha) = p^\\alpha$ for all primes $p$ and $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nProof. We proceed by induction. The base case is already done. Now, assume that $\\forall k < \\alpha$, we have $f(p^k) = g(p^k) = p^k$.\n\nLet $t = g^{-1}(p^\\alpha)$. Now, if $q$ is a prime such that $q | t$, then $f(q) | p^\\alpha \\implies q | p \\implies p = q$. Thus, $t$ is a power of $p$. Let $t = p^{\\alpha'}$. Now, by Claim 2, $\\alpha' \\le \\alpha$ but $\\forall \\alpha' < \\alpha$, $g(p^{\\alpha'}) = p^{\\alpha'}$. Thus, $\\alpha = \\alpha'$. Thus, $g(p^\\alpha) = p^\\alpha$.\n\nNow, $f(p^\\alpha) | p^\\alpha$. Thus, $f(p^\\alpha) = p^s$ for some $s \\le \\alpha$ but we know that $f^{-1}(p^s) = p^s$ for all $s < \\alpha$. Thus, $s = \\alpha$.\n\nThus, $f(p^\\alpha) = g(p^\\alpha) = p^\\alpha$ as desired.\n\nClaim 5 $x|g(x)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nProof. Let $p^\\alpha|x$, then $f(p^\\alpha)|g(x) \\implies p^\\alpha|g(x)$. Going over all prime divisors of $x$, we get that $x|g(x)$ $\\square$\n\nNow, we have that $x \\le g(x)$ for all $x$. So, consider the smallest $x$ such that $x \\neq g(x)$. Then, we get that $g^{-1}(x) > x$ since $\\forall y < x, g(y) = y$. This is a contradiction since $g^{-1}(x) > g(g^{-1}(x))$.\n\nThus, $g(x) = x$ for all $x$. Now, we have that $x|x \\implies f(x)|x$ for all $x$ and in particular that $f(x) \\le x$ for all $x$. Now, consider the smallest $x$, such that $f(x) \\neq x$. Then, $f(x) > x$ since $f^{-1}(y) = y$ for all $y < x$.\n\nThus, $f(x) = x$ for all $x$ and our conclusion follows.\n\nThe general idea for this conclusion and Claim 2 in Solution A1 is that if $a, b$ are bijective on $\\mathbb{N}$ and $a(x) \\le b(x)$ for all $x$ implies that $a = b$. We earlier use this with $f = a$ and $g = b$. Now, we use $a = id$ and $b = g$. Then finally with $a = f$ and $b = id$.",

Further, $f(q) | g(q) = p$ and $f(q) \\ne 1$ by injectivity \\implies f(q) = p$.

Hence $q = p$, and so $f(q) = g(q) = p$. $\\square$\n\nNow we use strong induction on $d(n)$ to prove $f(n) = g(n) = n$. Bases cases are $d(n) = 1$ and $d(n) = 2$; these are done since $f(1) = g(1) = 1$ and $f(p) = g(p) = p$ for primes $p$.\n\nNow assume the claim is true for all $m$ such that $d(m) \\le k$, for some $k \\ge 2$. Let $n$ satisfy $d(n) = k+1$. Suppose $g(y) = n$. By Claim 2, $d(y) \\le d(n)$. If $d(y) < d(n)$, by induction hypothesis we have $y = g(y) = n$, contradiction! Hence $d(y) = d(n)$. We have two cases:\n\nCase I: $y$ is not a power of a prime.\n\nLet $y = p_1^{a_1} \\cdot p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_j^{a_j}$. Then each $p_i^{a_i}$ has $a_i + 1 < d(y) = k + 1$ divisors, so $f(p_i^{a_i}) = p_i^{a_i}$. Therefore $p_i^{a_i} | g(y) = n$ for all $i \\implies y | n$. But, we have $d(y) = d(n)$, so $y = n$, and $g(n) = n$.\n\nCase II: $y = p^a$ for some prime $p$.\n\nSince $d(y) = k+1$, $a = k \\ge 2$. Then $d(p^{k-1}) = k \\implies f(p^{k-1}) = p^{k-1}$ by induction hypothesis $\\implies p^{k-1} | g(y) = n$. If some prime $q \\ne p$ divides $n$, then $p^{k-1}q | n \\implies d(n) \\ge d(p^{k-1}q) = 2k > k + 1$ since $k \\ge 2$, contradiction! Therefore $n = p^b$, and $d(n) = k+1 \\implies n = p^k = y$. Hence $g(n) = n$ in this case as well.\n\nThen $f(n) | g(n) = n$, so $f(n) \\ne n \\implies d(f(n)) < d(n) \\implies f(n) = f(f(n))$ by induction hypothesis $\\implies f(n) = n$ by injectivity, contradiction!

Then $P(k) = 10^{tn}X^n + a_{n-1}10^{t(n-1)}X^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_0$. For $i \\le n-2$, $a_i X^i$ has at most $t$ digits, so $a_i 10^{ti}X^i < 10^{t(i+1)}$ has at most $t(i+1)$ digits, while $a_{i+1} 10^{t(i+1)}X^{i+1}$ has at least $t(i+1)$ zeros. Thus these terms do not interact and there is no carry-over while adding them.\n\nFinally, $10^{tn+1} > a_{n-1}10^{t(n-1)}X^{n-1} \\ge 9 \\cdot 10^{tn}$, thus $a_{n-1}10^{t(n-1)}X^{n-1}$ has exactly $tn+1$ digits, with the leading digit being 9. On the other hand, $10^t X^n$ has exactly $tn$ zeros followed by a 01 (since $X \\equiv 1 \\pmod{100}$). Therefore, when we add the terms, the 9 and 1 turn into 0, the 0 turns into 1, and nothing else is affected.\n\nPutting everything together, we get\n\n$$\ns(P(k)) = -9 + \\sum_{i=0}^{n} s(a_i k^i) = -9 + \\sum_{i=0}^{n} s(a_i X^i)\n$$\n\nFrom the given condition, the LHS has the same parity as $s(k) = s(10^t X) = s(X)$, while by the Claim, the RHS has the same parity as $s(X) - 9$, which has a different parity from $s(X)$, contradiction! $\\square$\n\nThe key idea was ensuring one carry-over happens while calculating $P(k)$. Another approach using this idea is to have $k^n$ end with a 25 and $a_{n-1}k^{n-1}$ start with a 5 or more. We can achieve this by taking $k$ to be a large power of 5 and using irrationality of $\\log_{10} 5$.",

Let $k, a, b, c$ denote the complex coordinates of $K, A, B, C$ respectively. Note that since $\\triangle KBA \\sim \\triangle KAC$ by AA test, $K$ is the center of spiral similarity sending $BA$ to $AC$.

Therefore, since $K \\in XY$, the equation of line $XY$ is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ny - \\frac{h}{2} \\left( \\frac{c^2 - 1}{c^2} \\right) &= \\frac{d}{h} \\left( x - \\frac{d}{2} \\left( \\frac{c^2 + 1}{c^2} \\right) \\right) \\\\\n\\implies y &= \\frac{d}{h}x + \\frac{c^2(h^2 - d^2) - h^2 - d^2}{2hc^2} \\\\\n\\implies y &= \\frac{d}{h}x + \\frac{h^2 - d^2 - 1}{2h}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe problem is equivalent to proving $\\frac{AX}{DX} = \\frac{AY}{DY}$. We will in fact prove that $\\frac{AX}{DX} = \\sqrt{2} = \\frac{AY}{DY}$. We will only prove the first equality, as the other one follows from symmetry. Let $X = (x_1, x_2)$.

We will solve the problem for $n$-tuples for any $n \\ge 3$, and show that $s = 3$ is the answer regardless of $n$.\n\nFor any tuple $\\mathbf{v}$, we denote by $\\mathbf{v}_i$ its $i$-th coordinate for $1 \\le i \\le n$. For a positive integer $n$ and a tuple $\\mathbf{v}$, let $n \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$ denote the tuple obtained by applying addition on $\\mathbf{v}$ with itself $n$ times. Let $\\mathbf{e}(i)$ denote the tuple with 1 in the $i$-th position and 0 everywhere else. We call a tuple \"positive\" is all of its entries are positive and \"negative\" if all of its entries are negative.\n\nWe will show that three tuples suffice, and then show that two tuples do not suffice.\n\n**Three tuples suffice.** Write $\\mathbf{c}$ for the tuple $(-1, -1, \\dots, -1)$.\n\nWe note that it is enough for Lucy to make the tuples $\\mathbf{e}(1), \\mathbf{e}(2), \\dots, \\mathbf{e}(n), \\mathbf{c}$; from those any other tuple $\\mathbf{v}$ can be made as follows. First choose a positive integer $k$ such that $k + \\mathbf{v}_i > 0$. Then she can make $\\mathbf{v}$ by just addition:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{v} = (k + \\mathbf{v}_1) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}(1) + (k + \\mathbf{v}_2) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}(2) + \\dots + (k + \\mathbf{v}_n) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}(n) + k \\cdot \\mathbf{c}\n$$\n\nLucy can take her three starting tuples as $\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{b}$ and $\\mathbf{c}$ where $\\mathbf{a}_i = -i^2$ and $\\mathbf{b}_i = i$ for all $1 \\le i \\le n$. For any $1 \\le j \\le n$, write $\\mathbf{d}(j)$ for the tuple $2 \\cdot \\mathbf{a} + 4j \\cdot \\mathbf{b} + (2j^2 - 1)\\mathbf{c}$, which Lucy can make by adding together $\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{b}, \\mathbf{c}$ repeatedly. This has $i$-th coordinate\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{d}(j)_i = -2i^2 + 4ji - (2j^2 - 1) = 1 - 2(i - j)^2\n$$\n\nThus $\\mathbf{d}(j)_i = 1$ iff $i = j$, and is $\\le -1$ otherwise. Hence Lucy can produce the tuple $\\mathbf{l} = (1, 1, \\dots, 1)$ by doing $\\mathbf{d}(1) \\lor \\mathbf{d}(2) \\lor \\dots \\lor \\mathbf{d}(n)$.\n\nThen she can produce the tuple $\\mathbf{0} = (0, 0, \\dots, 0)$ by doing $\\mathbf{1} + \\mathbf{c}$, and she can get $\\mathbf{e}(i)$ by doing $\\mathbf{d}(i) \\lor \\mathbf{0}$. Since she already has $\\mathbf{c}$, as argued earlier, she can produce all integer tuples.\n\n**Two tuples do not suffice.** We start with an observation: Let $A$ be a non-negative real number and suppose two tuple $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{w}$ satisfy $\\mathbf{v}_j \\ge A\\mathbf{v}_k$ and $\\mathbf{w}_j \\ge A\\mathbf{w}_k$ for some $1 \\le j \\ne k \\le n$. Then the same inequality holds for $\\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}$ and $\\mathbf{v} \\lor \\mathbf{w}$. Indeed:\n\n$$\n(\\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w})_j = \\mathbf{v}_j + \\mathbf{w}_j \\ge A(\\mathbf{v}_k + \\mathbf{w}_k) = A(\\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w})_k \\\\ \\max(\\mathbf{v}_j, \\mathbf{w}_j) \\ge \\max(A\\mathbf{v}_k, A\\mathbf{w}_k) = A\\max(\\mathbf{v}_k, \\mathbf{w}_k)\n$$\n\nsince $A \\ge 0$. Thus any tuple generated from these two tuples satisfies this inequality, and so we cannot generate all integer tuples.\n\nAssume that Lucy starts with two tuples $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{w}$. We will distinguish two cases. In the first case, there is some $1 \\le i \\le n$ such that $\\mathbf{v}_i, \\mathbf{w}_i \\ge 0$. Since both operations preserve sign, we cannot generate any tuple with a negative $i$-th coordinate. Similarly for $\\mathbf{v}_i, \\mathbf{w}_i \\le 0$.\n\nIn the second case, either $\\mathbf{v}_i > 0 > \\mathbf{w}_i$ or $\\mathbf{v}_i < 0 < \\mathbf{w}_i$ for all $1 \\le i \\le n$. Since $n \\ge 3$, by pigeonhole principle, there exist distinct indices $j \\ne k$ such that $\\mathbf{v}_j$ has the same sign as $\\mathbf{v}_k$ and $\\mathbf{w}_j$ has the same sign as $\\mathbf{w}_k$.\n\nWLOG assume $\\mathbf{v}_k, \\mathbf{v}_k > 0$ and $\\mathbf{w}_j, \\mathbf{w}_k < 0$. Let $A = \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_j}{\\mathbf{v}_k}$. If $\\frac{\\mathbf{w}_j}{\\mathbf{w}_k} \\ge A$, both inequalities $\\mathbf{v}_j \\ge A\\mathbf{v}_k$ and $\\mathbf{w}_j \\ge A\\mathbf{w}_k$ hold. If $\\frac{\\mathbf{w}_j}{\\mathbf{w}_k} \\le A$, both inequalities $\\mathbf{v}_k \\ge \\frac{1}{A}\\mathbf{v}_j$ and $\\mathbf{w}_k \\ge \\frac{1}{A}\\mathbf{w}_j$ hold. In any case, by the above observation, Lucy cannot obtain all integer tuples starting from just $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{w}$, so two tuples do not suffice. $\\square$",

Further, coordinate of $U$ is $\\frac{a^2-ab-ac-bc}{2}$ by midpoint formula. By projection formula, we get the coordinate of $D$ as $\\frac{(bc-a^2)(b+c)+a(b^2+c^2)}{2a}$. Also, $\\angle I_aDC$ is the same as directed angle from $I_aD$ to $BC$, so we have to prove\n\n$$\n\\frac{M-Z}{U-Z} \\bigg/ \\frac{C-B}{I_a-D} \\in \\mathbb{R}\n$$\n\nPutting the coordinates in, this is equivalent to proving $\\frac{bc-a^2}{a(b-c)} \\in \\mathbb{R}$. If we let $y$ be that quantity, we have\n\n$$\n\\bar{y} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{bc} - \\frac{1}{a^2}}{\\frac{1}{ab} - \\frac{1}{ac}} = \\frac{bc - a^2}{a(b-c)} = y\n$$\n\nHence $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, as needed. □",

Let $N$ be midpoint of arc $BAC$, and let $MD$ intersect $\\odot(ABC)$ again at $D'$.\n\n**Claim 1** $D', I, Z$ are collinear.\n\n*Proof.* Consider an inversion with center $M$ and radius $MB$. $B, C, I$ are fixed since $MB = MC = MI$. The inversion interchanges line $BC$ and $\\odot(ABC)$, so $D' \\leftrightarrow D$.

Let $MV, ZU$ intersect $\\odot(ABC)$ at $V', V''$ respectively. Since $V$ is midpoint of $ID$, we have $(I, D; V, P_\\infty) = -1$ where $P_\\infty$ is the point at infinity along $ID$. Since $MN \\parallel ID$, projecting from $M$ onto $\\odot(ABC)$ we get $(A, D'; V', N) = -1$. Similarly, since $U$ is midpoint of $AI$, we have $(A, I; U, P'_\\infty) = -1$ where $P'_\\infty$ is the point at infinity along $AI$. Since $ZN \\parallel AI$, projecting from $M$ onto $\\odot(ABC)$ we get $(A, D'; V'', N) = -1$.\n\n$$\n\\implies (A, D'; V', N) = (A, D'; V'', N)\n$$\n\nTherefore $V' = V''$, as required. □\n\nNote that $\\square LZMU$ is a rectangle, and $ID \\parallel MN$, so\n\n$$\n\\angle DVM = \\angle VMN = \\angle V'MN = \\angle V'ZN = \\angle L'ZL = \\angle L'ML = \\angle IML\n$$\n\nas required. □",

Further, let\n\n$$\nS = \\left\\{ \\frac{n+1}{n} : n \\in \\mathbb{Z}, n \\neq 0 \\right\\}\n$$\n\nWe prove that $Z = S$ by showing the two inclusions $S \\subseteq Z$ and $Z \\subseteq S$.\n\nWe first prove that $S \\subseteq Z$. Let $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$ and let $P(x, y)$ denote the relation $f(x + f(y)) = f(x) + f(y)$. Let $f(0) = c$. $P(0, 0)$ gives $f(c) = 2c$. We claim that $f(kc) = (k + 1)c$ for all $k \\ge 1$. We prove this by induction on $k$. Base case $k = 1$ is already proved. Assume this is true for some $k$, then $P(0, kc)$ gives $f((k + 1)c) = (k + 2)c$, as required. Thus the claim is proved.\n\nWe now claim that $f(-kc) = (-k + 1)c$ for every integer $k \\ge 1$. Indeed, $P(-kc, kc)$ gives\n\n$$\nf(c) = f(-kc) + (k+1)c \\implies f(-kc) = (-k+1)c\n$$\n\nThus $f(kc) = (k + 1)c = \\frac{k+1}{k} \\cdot (kc)$ is true for every integer $k \\neq 0$, so $\\frac{k+1}{k} \\in Z$ for every $k \\neq 0$. Thus $S \\subseteq Z$, as required.\n\nNow we prove $Z \\subseteq S$. Let $p$ be a rational number outside $S$. We want to prove $p \\notin Z$ by constructing an $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$ with $f(z) \\neq pq$ for every $z \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The strategy is to first construct a function $g : [0, 1) \\to \\mathbb{Z}$, and then define $f(x) = g(\\{x\\}) + \\lfloor x \\rfloor$. This $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$; indeed:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x + f(y)) &= g(\\{x + f(y)\\}) + \\lfloor x + f(y) \\rfloor \\\\\n&= g(\\{x + g(\\{y\\}) + \\lfloor y \\rfloor\\}) + \\lfloor x + g(\\{y\\}) + \\lfloor y \\rfloor \\rfloor \\\\\n&= g(\\{x\\}) + \\lfloor x \\rfloor + g(\\{y\\}) + \\lfloor y \\rfloor \\\\\n&= f(x) + f(y)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere we used that $g$ only takes integer values.\n\n**Claim 1** For every $\\alpha \\in [0, 1)$, there exists an $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that\n\n$$\nm + n \\neq p(\\alpha + n)\n$$\n\nfor every $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n*Proof.* If $p = 1$, we can just take $m = 1$ since $\\alpha < 1$. If $p \\neq 1$, the claim is equivalent to the existence of an integer $m$ such that\n\n$$\n\\frac{m - p\\alpha}{p - 1}\n$$\n\nis not an integer. Assume the contrary. That would mean that\n\n$$\n\\frac{m - p\\alpha}{p - 1} \\text{ and } \\frac{(m + 1) - p\\alpha}{p - 1}\n$$\n\nare both integers, and so is their difference. The latter is equal to $\\frac{1}{p-1}$. But since we assumed $p \\neq S$, $\\frac{1}{p-1} \\neq \\mathbb{Z}$, contradiction! $\\square$\n\nDefine $g: [0, 1) \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ by $g(\\alpha) = m$ for any integer $m$ satisfying Claim 1 for $\\alpha$. Then $f(z) \\neq pz$ if and only if\n\n$$\ng(\\{z\\}) + \\lfloor z \\rfloor \\neq p(\\{z\\} + \\lfloor z \\rfloor)\n$$\n\nBut this is guaranteed by the construction of the function $g$. We conclude that $p \\notin \\mathbb{Z}$. Thus $Z \\subseteq S$, as required. $\\square$",
