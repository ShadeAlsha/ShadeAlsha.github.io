Observe that $r > 2$ because $2m+1 \\ge 5$,\n\n(i) $r \\le m$:\n\nSince $1 < r - 1 < m$, we may take $a := r - 1$. Then $1 < a < m$ and\n\\[\n2^{a+1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2m+1} \\iff \\begin{array}{l} (\\epsilon=0) \\\\ 2^a \\in A_m. \\end{array}\n\\]\n\n(ii) $r > m$:\n\nSince $2m+1$ is odd, $\\phi(2m+1)$ is even. Furthermore,\n\\[\nr | \\phi(2m+1), \\phi(2m+1) \\le 2m \\implies r = \\phi(2m+1).\n\\]\nThat is, 2 is a primitive root (mod $2m + 1$). Thus, $2^{r/2} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{2m+1}$. This is because\n\\[\n\\begin{align*} \n\\exists s (0 < s < r), 2^s \\equiv -1 \\pmod{2m+1} &\\implies 2^{2s} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2m+1} \\\\ \n&\\implies r \\mid 2s, 0 < 2s < 2r \\\\ \n&\\implies 2s = r. \n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nTake $a := (r/2) - 1$. Then, from $4 \\le r = \\phi(2m+1) \\le 2m$, we obtain $1 \\le a < m$ and\n\\[\n2^{a+1} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{2m+1} \\quad \\stackrel{(\\epsilon=1)}{\\implies} \\quad 2^a + 1 \\in A_m.\n\\]\n\n(2) For a given $m$, we observed that $2^{r-1} \\in A_m$ in (1) above, where $r = \\text{ord}_{2m+1}(2)$. Furthermore, it is clear that the smallest $a$, for which $2^a \\in A_m$, holds, is $a_0 = r - 1$.\n\n(i) $r$ is even and $2^{r/2} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{2m+1}$:\n\nIn this case, $2^{(r/2)-1} + 1 \\in A_m$ holds, and the smallest $b$ for which $2^b + 1 \\in A_m$ holds is $b_0 = (r/2) - 1$.\n\n(ii) $r$ is even and $2^{r/2} \\not\\equiv -1 \\pmod{2m+1}$:\n\nLet's assume that there exists an $s$ with $0 < s < r$ satisfying $2^s \\equiv -1 \\pmod{2m+1}$. Then from $2^{2s} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2m+1}$, we get $r \\mid 2s$. Since $2s \\not\\equiv r \\pmod{2r}$, $2s \\ge 3r$, that is, $s > r$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, in this case, $A_m$ contains no element of the form $2^b + 1$.\n\n(iii) $r$ is odd:\n\nLet's assume that there exists an $s$ with $0 < s < r$ satisfying $2^s \\equiv -1 \\pmod{2m+1}$. Then from $2^{2s} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2m+1}$, we get $r \\mid 2s$ and hence $r \\mid s$ because $r$ is odd. But this is absurd since $0 < s < r$. Therefore, in this case again, $A_m$ contains no element of the form $2^b + 1$.\n\nCombining (i~iii), we may conclude that\n\\[\nb_0 = \\frac{a_0 + 1}{2} - 1 = \\frac{a_0 - 1}{2}. \\quad \\square\n\\]\n\nAlternative solution for (2)\n\nLet $x, y$ be the smallest positive integers satisfying\n\\[\n2^x \\equiv -1 \\pmod{2m+1}, \\quad 2^y \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2m+1}.\n\\]\nClearly, $0 < x < y \\le 2x$. Assume that $y = xq + r$ ($0 \\le r < x$). Since\n\\[\n1 \\equiv 2^y \\equiv (2^x)^{q2^r} \\equiv (-1)^{q2^r} \\pmod{2m+1}.\n\\]\n$q$ should be even. Hence $q = 2$ and $r = 0$. This completes the proof. $\\square$",

We write $p^c \\nmid n$ when a positive integer $n$ is a multiple of $p^c$, but not of $p^{c+1}$ for a prime $p$.\n\n\\textbf{Lemma 1.} For a given prime $q$ and a positive integer $a$ such that $(a, q) = 1$, let $s$ be the smallest positive integer $x$ satisfying $q|x^s = 1$. Any positive integer $y$ such that $q|a^y - 1$ must be a multiple of $s$.\n\n\\textit{Proof.} Put $y = qs + r_0$, where $q, r_0$ are integers and $0 \\le r_0 < s$. Noting $q|a^y - 1 = (a^s - 1)(a^{y-s} + a^{y-2s} + \\dots + a^{r_0}) + a^{r_0} - 1$ leads us to $q|a^{r_0} - 1$. By the minimality of $s$, we get $r_0 = 0$. $\\square$\n\n1. The case of $p = 2$\n\nIt is immediate to note that all $n_i$s are odd and greater than or equal to 3. Let $q(\\ge 3)$ be the smallest prime dividing one of $n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_k$. Without loss of generality, we assume $q|n_2$. Let $s \\ge 2$ be the smallest positive integer $x$ satisfying $q|2^r - 1$. then by Fermat's little theorem and Lemma 1, we get $s|q - 1$. thus $s < q$. We realize that $s$ has a smaller prime factor than $q$, so it contradicts $q|2^{n_1} - 1$. which implies $s|n_1$. We conclude that there does not exist $(n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_k)$ fulfilling conditions hence 2 is not a nice prime.\n\n2. The case of prime $p \\ge 3$\n\n(1) In the case $k = 1$: we prove that there does not exist a positive integer $n$ such that $n|p^n - 1$ and $(\\frac{p^{n}-1}{n}, n) = 1$.\n\nFirst, under the condition $n|p^n - 1$, we show the smallest prime factor $q_1$ of $n$ must divide $p-1$. Let $n = q_1^{e_1} \\cdots q_r^{e_r}$. $q_1 < \\cdots < q_r$. $n|p^n - 1$ implies $q_1|p^n - 1$. Let $s$ be the smallest positive integer $x$ such that $q_1|p^x - 1$. then it is obvious that $s \\le q_1 - 1$ and $s|n$. If $s > 1$, $s$ is a product of primes smaller than $q_1$, it violates that $n$ cannot have smaller prime factors than $q_1$. We obtain $s = 1$ so $q_1|p - 1$.\n\nNow let $n = q_1^{e_1} n_0$. In the expression $p^n - 1 = p^{q_1^{e_1} n_0} - 1 = (p^{n_0} - 1) \\prod_{j=0}^{e_1-1} \\frac{p^{q_1^{j-1} n_0} - 1}{p^{q_1^{j-1} n_0} - 1}$. we easily see the number of prime $q_1$ in $p^n - 1$ is at least $e_1 + 1$. So we get $q_1|(\\frac{p^{n}-1}{n}, n)$ reducing to contradiction. In sum, for any given prime $p$, there does not exist a positive integer $n$ satisfying all conditions when $k = 1$.\n\n(2) In the case $k \\ge 2$: we are always able to find sequences of positive integers $(n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_k)$ for infinitely many $k$. This proves that any odd primes are nice. There are various ways of taking the sequences and the proposed way below is one of them.\n\n\\textbf{Lemma 2.} For a positive integer $c$ and a prime $q$, $q^c|p-1$ implies $q^{c+d}|p^{q^d} - 1$. Moreover,\n\n- When $q$ is odd or $(q = 2, c \\ge 2)$: the smallest positive integer $x$ such that $q^{c+d}|p^x - 1$ is $q^d$ and $q^{c+d}||p^{q^d} - 1$ holds.\n\n- When $(q = 2, c = 1)$: Let $c'$ be the smallest positive integer such that $2^{c'}||p^2 - 1$. Then the smallest positive integer $x$ satisfying $2^{c'-d}||p^x - 1$ is $2^{d+1}$ and $2^{c'+d}||p^{2d+1}-1$ holds.\n\nProof. Let us show only the first case. When $d=0$, it is true by definition. Let us assume the statement is true when $d=d_0$ and try to show when $d=d_0+1$. We need to find the smallest positive integer $x$ such that $q^{c+d_0+1}||p^x-1$. Since $q^{c-d_0}||p^x-1$ also holds, by the assumption, $x$ is a multiple of $q^{d_0}$ and we set $x=q^{d_0}u$. From the equation $p^x-1 = p^{q^{d_0}u}-1 = (p^{q^{d_0}}-1)(p^{(u-1)q^{d_0}}+p^{(u-2)q^{d_0}}+\\cdots+1)$, $p^{q^{d_0}}-1$ is already a multiple of $q^{c+d_0}$, so it is enough to have $p^{(u-1)q^{d_0}}+p^{(u-2)q^{d_0}}+c\\cdots+1$ a multiple of $q$. $p^{(u-1)q^{d_0}}+p^{(u-2)q^{d_0}}+c\\cdots+1\\equiv 1+\\cdots+1\\equiv u\\pmod q$ implies $q\\nmid u$ and conversely, we easily check $p^x-1$ is really a multiple of $q^{c+d_0+1}$ when $q$ divides $u$. Thus $x=q^{d_0}u$ is a multiple of $q^{d_0+1}$.\n\nOn the other hand, $\\frac{p^{q^{d_0}-1}}{p^{q^{d_0}-1}} = p^{(q-1)q^{d_0}} + p^{(q-2)q^{d_0}} + \\cdots + 1$ is only a multiple of $q$ not of $q^2$, whose proof is presented below. In conclusion, we obtain $q^{c+d}||p^{q^d}-1$ by induction.\n\nThe reason for $q||p^{(q-1)q^{d_0}} + p^{(q-2)q^{d_0}} + \\cdots + 1$: Let $v$ be a positive integer such that $p^{q^{d_0}} = 1+qv$. Then, $p^{(q-1)q^{d_0}} + p^{(q-2)q^{d_0}} + \\cdots + 1 = (1+qv)^{q-1} + (1+qv)^{q-2} + \\cdots + (1+qv) + 1 \\equiv 1 + (q-1)qv + 1 + (q-2)qv + \\cdots + (1+qv) + 1 = q + \\frac{(q-1)q^2}{2}v \\equiv q \\pmod{q^2}$.\n\nIn the case $(q=2, c=1)$, we are not able to guarantee the term $\\frac{(q-1)q^2}{2}v$ in the almost last equation is a multiple of $q^2$ so we separate the case. $\\square$\n\nNow we define $S = \\{q|q$ a prime dividing $p-1\\}$ and let $q \\in S$. Take $n_1 = p-1$ and let $c_{q,1}$ be an integer such that $q^{c_{q,1}}||p-1$ for $q \\in S$. Similarly, we define $c_{q,2}$ as an integer satisfying $q^{c_{q,2}}||p^{n_1}-1 = p^{n_1-1}-1$. inductively for $q \\in S, i \\ge 1$, let $c_{q,i+1}$ be an integer such that $q^{c_{q,i+1}}||p^{n_i}-1$ and $n_{i+1} := \\prod_{q \\in S} q^{c_{q,i+1}}$.\n\nWe define $c_{q,i}$ and $n_i$ in this way accordingly as $i$ gets increased one by one, then we notice that $c_{q,i}$ also gets large as $i$ does so. Fix $q_0 \\in S$ and put $c := c_{q_0,1}$. (When $q_0 = 2, c_{q_0,1} = 1$, let $c = c' - 1$, where $c'$ is in Lemma 2.(ii).)\n\nSince there exists an integer $i$ such that $q_0^{c_{q_0,i}} > p-1$, we call such $i$ $i_0$. Moreover, there exists a positive integer $k_0$ such that $\\frac{p^{k_0}-1}{(p-1)q_0^{k_0}} \\ge \\frac{p+1}{2}$, which is justified by that the left hand side is a function divergent when $k_0$ goes to infinity.

Let us also extend the initial chessboard by 1 row to the top and 1 column to the left. We assign $-\\infty$ to each of those new unit squares so that the number of shelves is preserved. For a shelf $R$, let us call the integer $h$ satisfying two conditions the *height* of $R$.\n\nClaim 1: If two shelves $R_1$ and $R_2$ do not intersect, then $\\tilde{R}_1 \\cap \\tilde{R}_2 = \\emptyset$.\n\nProof of Claim 1: Let $h_1, h_2$ be the height of $R_1, R_2$ respectively. Without loss of generality, let us assume $h_1 \\le h_2$. If $\\tilde{R}_1 \\cap \\tilde{R}_2 \\ne \\emptyset$, then some unit square $x$ in $R_2$ is adjacent to $R_1$ and therefore the integer in $x$ is less than or equal to $h_1$. Since $x \\in R_2$, the integer in $x$ is larger than $h_2$, contradictory to the assumption that $h_1 \\le h_2$. This proves Claim 1.\n\n**Claim 2:** If $R_1$ and $R_2$ are distinct maximal shelves smaller than the whole chessboard, then $R_1 \\cap R_2 = \\emptyset$.\n\n**Proof of Claim 2:** Let $h_1, h_2$ be the height of $R_1, R_2$ respectively. Without loss of generality, let us assume $h_1 \\le h_2$. Suppose that $R_1 \\cap R_2 \\ne \\emptyset$. Suppose a unit square $x$ in $R_2$ shares at least one point with $R_1$. If $x$ does not belong to $R_1$, then the integer in $x$ should be at most $h_1$ but since $x \\in R_2$, the integer in $x$ should be larger than $h_2$, contradictory to the assumption that $h_1 \\le h_2$. So such $x$ belongs to $R_1$ and therefore $R_2 \\subseteq R_1$. However this contradicts to the assumption that $R_2$ is maximal. So Claim 2 is proved.\n\n**Claim 3:** The number of shelves in the $n \\times m$ chessboard is less than or equal to $\\frac{(n+1)(m+1)}{2} - 1$.\n\n**Proof of Claim 3:** We proceed by induction on $n+m$. If $n+m=2$, then $n=m=1$ and the number of shelves is 1.\n\nNow let us assume $n+m > 2$. Let $R_1, R_2, \\dots, R_k$ be the maximal shelves strictly smaller than the whole $n \\times m$ chessboard.\n\nBy Claims 1 and 2, $\\tilde{R}_i \\cap \\tilde{R}_j = \\emptyset$. By the induction hypothesis, the number of shelves contained in $R_i$ for each $i$ is at most $|\\tilde{R}_i|/2 - 1$. Therefore the number of all shelves is at most\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\left( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{|\\tilde{R}_i|}{2} \\right\\rfloor - 1 \\right) \\le \\frac{(n+1)(m+1)}{2} - k - 1.\n$$\n\nSo Claim 3 is proved if $k > 1$. We may now assume that $k=1$. Then it is enough to show that\n\n$$\n\\max \\left( \\frac{m(n+1)}{2} \\cdot \\frac{(m+1)n}{2} \\right) - 1 + 1 \\le \\frac{(n+1)(m-1)}{2} - 1.\n$$\n\nIt is easy to see this because $n \\ge 1$ is equivalent to the inequality that $\\frac{m+n-1}{2} \\le \\frac{(n+1)(m+1)}{2} - 1$. This proves Claim 3.\n\nNow it remains to show that there is an assignment of integers so that the number of shelves is exactly $\\lceil(n+1)(m+1)/2\\rceil - 1$. We proceed by induction on $n+m$. It is trivial if $\\max(n,m) \\le 2$.\n\nNow by symmetry let us assume that $m > 2$. Let us write 1 in each unit square on the second row. For the first row, we write integers larger than 1 obtained by the induction hypothesis on a $1 \\times n$ chessboard. For the remaining rows, we write integers larger than 1 obtained by the induction hypothesis on a $(m-2) \\times n$ chessboard.\n\nNow the number of shelves in this assignment is\n\n$$\n1 + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2(n+1)}{2} - 1 \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lceil \\frac{(m-1)(n+1)}{2} - 1 \\right\\rceil\n$$\n\nby the induction hypothesis. This completes the proof. \\(\\Box\\)",

From the induction hypothesis, $\\{B_i - \\{p\\} | i \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ is nice, which induces easily that $\\{B_i | i \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ is nice. Thus the collection $A_1, A_2, \\dots$ is also nice. $\\square$\n\nLet us go back to the original problem. If $A_1, A_2, \\dots$ satisfies the condition in Lemma 1 then it is done. Otherwise $\\exists p$ s.t. $p = (a, b)$ is contained in infinitely many $A_i$'s, then each cardinality of $A_i \\in p$ is bounded by $|A_i| \\le a + b + 1$ (recall that $A_i$'s are reduced sets). Thus from the corollary 2, the collection of $A_i$'s containing $p$ is nice, and so does the original collection $A_1, A_2, \\dots$, which completes the proof.\n\nNow we only left the proof of Lemma 1.\n\n\\textit{Proof.} (Lemma 1) For nonnegative integer $h$, define $V_h := \\bigcup A_i \\cap \\{(h, y) | y \\in \\mathbb{N}_0\\}$. If $V_h$ is a finite set then by the hypothesis of Lemma 1, only finitely many $A_i$'s contribute to $V_h$. So we may delete this finitely many $A_i$'s."

Assume that $(s, t, w)$ is the positive integer solution of $w^2 = 6s^2t^2 - s^4 - t^4 = (2st)^2 - (s^2 - t^2)^2$ which make $s+t$ minimum.\n\nBecause $2st$ is even in the Pythagorean triple $\\{w, s^2 - t^2, 2st\\}$, we know $s^2 - t^2$ is even and $s$ and $t$ are odd.

Similarly one can show it satisfies other requirements for equivalence relations. Also $S, T(S), T^2(S), \\dots, T^{p-1}(S)$ are all distinct and $T^p(S) = S$, so one can observe any equivalence class has size $p$.\n\nEach of the equivalence classes contains exactly one element whose sum is $\\equiv i \\pmod p$ for any $0 \\le i < p$.

Subtracting $mp$ from all elements of $S_2$ corresponds $S_2$ to a subset of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, p\\}$, and this correspondence also preserves sum of elements mod $p$.

Then by (iii), $k_3 = s_2$, $y_{k_3} = b$ and $s_1 = 0$, $k_1 + k_2 = s_3$.

If $a_i - a_{i+1}$ and $a_{i+2} - a_{i+3}$ have the same sign then $|a_i - a_{i+1} + a_{i+2} - a_{i+3}| = |a_i - a_{i+1}| + |a_{i+2} - a_{i+3}|$, and if $a_i - a_{i+1}$ and $a_{i+2} - a_{i+3}$ have the different signs then\n\n$$ |a_i - a_{i+1} + a_{i+2} - a_{i+3}| = \\|a_i - a_{i+1}| - |a_{i+2} - a_{i+3}|\\| \\le |a_i - a_{i+1}| + |a_{i+2} - a_{i+3}| - 2. $$\nSo $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - a_{i+1} + a_{i+2} - a_{i+3}|$ is at most\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} & \\sum_{1 \\le i \\le n, i \\ne p, q} (|a_i - a_{i+1}| + |a_{i+2} - a_{i+3}|) \\\\ & \\quad + |a_p - a_{p+1}| + |a_{p+2} - a_{p+3}| + |a_q - a_{q+1}| + |a_{q+2} - a_{q+3}| - 4 \\\\ & = 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - a_{i+1}| - 4. \\end{aligned}\n$$",
