In other words, if there are no solutions for $y > 0$, then there are no other solutions. Therefore, we can assume that $y > 0$.\n\nThe given equation can be written as:\n\n$$\nx^3 = (y - x)(x + y + 1). \\qquad (4.2)\n$$\n\nLet us prove that $M(y - x, x + y + 1) = 1$. Assume the contrary, let $p$ be the common prime divisor of the numbers $y - x$ and $x + y + 1$."

We conclude that adding a red ball does not change the parity of the number of blue balls. Also removing a red ball does not change the parity of the number of blue balls.\n\nIn the beginning there is no blue balls, so after each operation the number of blue balls is even. Hence it is not possible that we obtain exactly 2013 blue balls.\n\nb) In a given configuration of balls, we label the blue balls clockwise $P_1, P_2, \\dots, P_{2k}$ starting with an arbitrary blue ball. Let $m_i$ ($i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 2k\\}$) be the number of red balls between balls $P_i$ and $P_{i+1}$ ($P_{n+1} = P_1$). For example, in the following picture we have $m_1 = 2, m_2 = 3, m_3 = 1, m_4 = 0, m_5 = 4, m_6 = 1$.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Mathematica_competitions_in_Croatia_in_2013_p25_data_ecf2d8ad35.png)\n\nFurthermore, let us denote $S = m_1 - m_2 + m_3 - \\dots + m_{2k-1} - m_{2k}$. If the configuration consists of $n$ red balls and no blue balls we denote $S = n$. Let us prove that either $S$ is divisible by three for all configurations or $S$ is not divisible by three for all configurations. We again consider three cases:\n\n1. We add a red ball between two blue balls, $P_i$ and $P_{i+1}$:\n\n$$\nP_{i-1} \\underbrace{\\dots P_i}_{m_{i-1}} \\underbrace{\\dots P_{i+1}}_{m_i=0} \\rightarrow P_{i-1}' \\underbrace{\\dots \\overbrace{CC}^{\\downarrow} \\dots P_i'}_{m_i'}\n$$\n\nBefore the operation we have $S = S_0 + m_{i-1} - m_i + m_{i+1} = S_0 + m_{i-1} + m_{i+1}$ and after the operation we have $S' = S_0 + m_i' = S_0 + (m_{i-1} + m_{i+1} + 3) = S + 3$.\n\n2. We add a red ball between two red balls:\n\n$$\nP_i \\underbrace{\\dots CC \\dots}_{m_i} P_{i+1} \\rightarrow P_i \\underbrace{\\dots P_{i+1}}_{m_i'} \\underbrace{\\overbrace{C}^{\\downarrow}}_{m_{i+1}'=1} P_{i+1} \\underbrace{\\dots P_{i+3}}_{m_{i+2}'}\n$$\n\nSimiliarly as before, $S = S_0 + m_i$, a $S' = S_0 + m_i' - 1 + m_{i+2}$. But now $m_i = m_i' + m_{i+2}' + 2$, so $S' = S - 3$.\n\n(Analogous statement holds in the case if there is no blue balls on the circle.)\n\n3. We add a red ball between one red and one blue ball (to the right of the blue ball $P_i$):\n\n$$\nP_{i-1} \\underbrace{\\overbrace{P_i}^{m_{i-1}} \\overbrace{C \\dots P_{i+1}}^{m_i}} \\rightarrow P_{i-1} \\underbrace{\\overbrace{\\dots \\overbrace{C}^{m'_{i-1}} C}^{\\downarrow} P_i}_{m'_i} \\dots P_i\n$$\n\nIn this case $S = S_0 + m_{i-1} - m_i$ and $S' = S_0 + m'_{i-1} - m'_i$. Since $m'_{i-1} = m_{i-1} + 2$ and $m'_i = m_i - 1$, we have $S' = S + 3$.\n\nIn any case, $S$ either decreases or increases by 3. In the beginning number $S$ is 2 and hence $S$ can never be divisible by three. We cannot obtain exactly two blue balls since $S$ would be 0.",

Let $K$ be the number of coins with black side up in that arrangement.\n\nObserve that, by removing some coin, board is divided in two parts and that the moves performed on one of these sides do not affect the coins on the other part.\n\nIf $K$ is odd, we will prove that it is possible to remove all coins. Let $Y$ be the first coin on the board that is turned with black side up. Assume that $Y$ is neither on the first, nor on the last square of the board, and denote by $X$ the coin on a square left to $Y$, and by $Z$ the coin on a square right of $Y$. In the first move, remove both $Y$ and its square (and turn $X$ and $Z$). This way, we obtain two smaller boards. We will show that we can remove all coins from both of them. On the first board there are coins being left of $Y$, and on the second one there are those who are right of $Y$.\n\nOn the first board all coins are turned with white side up, except $X$ which was just turned so that it is black side up.

If $Z$ is black side up, then, after the move, the number of coins on the other board with black side up will be equal to $K - 2$. In both cases the number is odd.

Beside $Y$, there was an odd number of coins on the board with black side up. The total number of coins turned with black side up on both parts of the board will still, after the move, be an odd number. Hence there is an even number of coins turned with black side up on one part of the board. By induction hypothesis, coins on that part cannot be removed, contradiction.

After each move there will be at least $(m-k) \\cdot (n-k)$ white squares in the array.\n\nWe will prove the above statement by induction on the number of squares in an array. For $m = k$ or $n = k$ the statement obviously holds. Let us assume that $m, n > k$ and that the statement holds for all arrays of dimensions smaller than $m \\times n$. Without loss of generality we may assume that in the last move we have performed the transformation on some row. In that row there must me at least $n-k$ white squares. If we disregard that row we may assume that all previous moves were made on an array of dimensions $(m-1) \\times n$. By the inductive hypothesis the smaller array has at least $(m-1-k) \\cdot (n-k)$ white square, and this implies that the array with dimensions $m \\times n$ has at least $(n-k) + (m-1-k)(n-k) = (m-k)(n-k)$ white squares. This proves the statement.\n\nLet $m = n = N$ and let us assume that after some number of moves number $i$ appears $A_i$ times in the array ($1 \\le i \\le N$). If we consider the squares in which there is number $N$ to be black, and all other squares to be white, then the above statement implies\n\n$$\nA_N \\le N^2 - (N-1)^2.\n$$\n\nMore generally, if we consider the squares in which numbers $S+1, \\dots, N+1, N$ ($S = N-1, N-2, \\dots, 0$) to be black, and all other squares to be white, then the above statement (with $k = N-S$) implies\n\n$$\nA_{S+1} + \\dots + A_N \\le N^2 - S^2.\n$$"

By the inductive hypothesis the smaller array has at least $(m-1-k) \\cdot (n-k)$ white square, and this implies that the array with dimensions $m \\times n$ has at least $(n-k) + (m-1-k)(n-k) = (m-k)(n-k)$ white squares.

On the other hand, we have that\n\n$$\na_m - a_l = k^l + \\dots + k^{m-1} = k^l (1 + \\dots + k^{m-l-1}) = k^l \\cdot a_{m-l}.\n$$\n\nFrom $2015 \\mid k^l \\cdot a_{m-l}$ and $M(k, 2015) = 1$, it follows that $2015 \\mid a_{m-l}$, which is in contradiction with the assumption that none of the numbers $a_1, \\dots, a_{2015}$ is divisible by 2015. Therefore, if $M(k, 2015) = 1$, the grasshopper will jump into a hole.\n\nTo conclude, the only numbers which are suitable for the terms of the problem are those which are not relatively prime to 2015.",

Therefore, $f(1) = 1$.\n\nPutting $x = 1$, $y = x$ into the given equation gives us\n\n$$\nf(x + 1) + f(x) = 2x + 1. \\tag{10}\n$$\n\nBy putting $y = 1$ into the given equation and using (5), we get\n\n$$\nf^2(x)(x - 1) + 2x^2 = xf(x)f(x + 1). \\tag{11}\n$$\n\nFor a given $x$, let $t = f(x)$. Combining (10) and (11) we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} & t^2(x - 1) + 2x^2 = xt(2x + 1 - t), \\\\ & (t - x)(2tx - t - 2x) = 0. \\end{aligned}\n$$"

This shows that the final order is determined by the selection of the number $k$ (which can be any of the numbers 0 through $n-2$) and the order in which we select marks $k+1$ through $n$ (the number of these selections is the same as the number of different final orders in a race with $n-k$ cyclists, i.e. $A_{n-k}$), i.e. we have that\n\n$$\nA_n = A_{n-1} + A_{n-2} + \\dots + A_2 + 1.\n$$\n\nSince $A_2 = 1$, it can be easily shown by induction that $A_n = 2^{n-2}$ for all positive integers $n$.

In the same manner, we would conclude that $II'$ is parallel to the remaining two lines passing through $P$ and one of the points at which the incircle touches the sides of the triangle ABC.

Assume there exist two segments of different colour, on the edge of the convex hull, with a common endpoint $A$. By the inductive assumption, the other $N$ points have a single-coloured spanning tree, say $T$. One of the segments on the edge of the convex hull containing $A$ must be of the same colour as $T$. Also, it can't intersect $T$. Adding that segment to $T$ gives us a single-coloured tree consisting of $N+1$ vertices.\n\nWithout loss of generality, we may assume that all segments on the edge of the convex hull are red. Introduce coordinates such that all the points have different $x$-coordinates. Assume the points $A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_{N+1}$ are ordered by ascending $x$-coordinate.\n\nFor $K = 2, \\dots, N$, by the inductive assumption, there exist single-coloured non-selfintersecting trees $L_K$ (for points $A_1, \\dots, A_K$) and $R_K$ (for points $A_K, \\dots, A_{N+1}$). If for some $K$ trees $L_K$ and $R_K$ are of the same colour, then $L_K \\cup R_K$ is a single-coloured tree for $N+1$ points. So let us assume for each $K = 2, \\dots, N$, that $L_K$ and $R_K$ are of different colour.\n\nIf $R_2$ is red, $R_2 \\cup \\{\\overline{A_1A_2}\\}$ is a single-coloured tree with $N+1$ vertices. So let us assume $R_2$ and, analogously, $L_N$ are blue. Hence, $R_N$ and $L_2$ must be red.\n\nSince $L_2$ is red and $L_N$ is blue, there must be some $K$ such that $L_K$ is red and $L_{K+1}$ is blue. Then $R_{K+1}$ is red and there exists a segment $\\overline{XY}$ on the edge of the convex hull such that $X$ is in $L_K$ and $Y$ is in $R_{K+1}$, e.g. we can choose points with greatest $y$-coordinates in $L_K$ and $R_{K+1}$ for $X$ and $Y$. Set of segments $L_K \\cup \\{\\overline{XY}\\} \\cup R_{K+1}$ is a single-coloured non-selfintersecting tree with $N+1$ vertices, which completes the proof.",

Now the problem is equivalent to the existence of a single-coloured tree.\n\nWe prove the statement by induction on $N$.

We conclude that there are at least 150 good pairs.\n\nAssume that there is an alternating arrangement $a_1, \\dots, a_{300}$ in which there are exactly 150 good pairs.\n\nWithout loss of generality, we can assume that $a_1 > a_2$, and that $(a_1, a_2)$ is not a good pair. Then $(a_{2k}, a_{2k+1})$ are both good, while the pair $(a_{2k-1}, a_{2k})$ is not, for any $k = 1, 2, \\dots, 149$. We also notice that $(a_{299}, a_{300})$ cannot be a good pair.\n\nSince $(a_1, a_2)$ is not good, we conclude that $a_1 > a_3$. Similarly, since $(a_3, a_4)$ is not good, we get $a_3 > a_5$. Continuing this way, we get\n\n$$\na_1 > a_3 > a_5 > \\dots > a_{299} > a_1,\n$$\n\nthus arriving at a contradiction. This shows that it is impossible to have exactly 150 good pairs. Therefore, there must be at least 151 of them.\n\nAn example of an alternating arrangement containing exactly 151 good pairs is\n\n3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, ..., 299, 298, 300, 1."

That means that this wall goes through the inner points of polygon $P$, and since the walls are mutually disjoint, we conclude that $w_1$ must also intersect a path which is the side of $P$, because it cannot pass through any of the vertices of $P$ except $A_1$. Let $C$ be the intersection of wall $w_1$ and a side of $P$. Consider the arc $\\overarc{A_1C}$ (clockwise from point $A_1$ to point $C$), and note that it contains points $A_2, \\dots, A_l$. We can repeat this inference for wall $A_2B_2$. Since all walls are mutually disjoint, its corresponding arc is strictly smaller than the arc of $w_1$.

By the inductive assumption, we can conclude that the claim holds for all points except possibly point $A_i$. However, by Claim 1, point $A_i$ is connected by a good path with at least one of the remaining points, which proves the claim for $n+1$.",

Let us assume $n$ is a good number and consider a fixed vertex $A$ of a regular $n$-gon coloured in the required way. For each vertex $B$ different from $A$, there is a unique vertex $C$ such that the sides of the triangle $ABC$ have the same colour. Hence, we may partition all vertices other than $A$ into pairs. This shows that $n$ is odd. From this we conclude that 8, 10 and 12 are not good numbers.\n\nNext, we show that numbers of the form $n = 3k + 2$ are not good. Again, let us assume $n$ is good and for a regular $n$-gon coloured in the required way, let $t$ be the number of triangles $ABC$ with all sides of the same colour. Each such triangle has exactly three pairs of vertices, while for each pair of vertices of the $n$-gon there is a unique triangle with all the sides of the same colour.
