The only possibility in writing 9 as a sum of at most four numbers of 3's and 1's is $9 = 3+3+3$, for 7 is $7 = 3+3+1$. In this case the number of all victories $w=n=5$ is reached by the first two teams. It follows that we have to write 5 points of the third as a sum of at most four numbers of 1's, which is impossible.\n\nFor $n=6$ we get the configuration $11, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1$.

Let $a, b, c$ and $d$ be numbers written in cells, which centers form a rectangle with the sides parallel to those of the table. Note that any move preserves the number $a-b+c-d$. Hence for any equilibrium table one has that\n\n$$\na_{ij} - a_{kj} = c_{ik}, \\quad a_{ji} - a_{jk} = d_{ik} \\quad (1)\n$$\n\nTherefore, such a table is determined by $2m-1$ arbitrary parameters; for example, the numbers in the first row and the first column. Any such table is equilibrium. Indeed, by moves on the columns we may obtain equal numbers in the first row. It follows from (1) that the numbers in any row are equal. Then by moves on the rows we may achieve all the numbers in the table to be equal. As a consequence, for $n = 2m-2$ we can construct an equilibrium table, containing $2m-1$ numbers: $2^0, 2^1, \\dots, 2^n$.\n\nWe shall show that this is the largest integer $n$, i.e. the numbers $2^0, 2^1, \\dots, 2^{2m-1}$ cannot be placed in an equilibrium table $m\\times m$. We shall show a more general statement.\n\n**Lemma.** The integers $b_1, \\dots, b_{2m}$ ($m \\ge 2$) can be placed in a $m\\times m$ equilibrium table if and only if there exists $p$, $2 \\le p \\le m$, such that after a permutation of these numbers one has that\n\n$$\nb_1 + \\dots + b_p = b_{m+1} + \\dots + b_{m+p} \\quad (2)\n$$\n\n**Proof.** Assume that such a location is possible. We shall prove (2) by induction on $m$. For $m=2$ this follows from (1) for $p=2$.\n\nSuppose that our statement is true for some $m-1 \\ge 2$. Consider an equilibrium table $m\\times m$, containing the numbers $b_1, \\dots, b_{2m}$.\n\nIf some row and some column contains each at most one of these numbers, we delete this row and this column and we get an equilibrium table $(m-1)\\times(m-1)$, containing at least $2m-2$ of the $b$'s. Applying the induction after a permutation of $b$'s the hypothesis gives (2).\n\nLet some row contain at most one $b$, but none of the columns has this property. This means that every column contains exactly two $b$'s. We delete our row and the column that contains the respective $b$ if there is such $b$, or any column if there is no such $b$, and we get an equilibrium table $(m-1)\\times(m-1)$, containing $2m-2$ of the $b$'s, and then we continue as above.\n\nThe situation is the same if some column contains at most one $b$, but no rows have this property.\n\nIt remains to consider the case, when any row and any column contain exactly two b's. After permutations of the rows and columns we may assume that (after a permutation of b's) $a_{ii} = b_i$ and $a_{i,i+1} = b_{m+i}$ for $1 \\le i \\le p-1$, $a_{p1} = b_{m+p}$ for some $p \\in \\{2, \\dots, m\\}$. Then\n\n$$\na_{i1} + a_{1i} - a_{11} = b_i, \\quad a_{i1} + a_{1,i+1} - a_{11} = b_{m+i} \\quad (1 \\le i \\le p-1), \\quad a_{p1} + a_{1p} - a_{11} = b_p.\n$$\n\nHence $b_i - b_{m+i} = a_{1i} - a_{1,i+1}$ for $1 \\le i \\le p-1$ and $b_p - b_{m+p} = a_{1p} - a_{11}$. Summing up these equalities we get that\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{p} (b_i - b_{m+i}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{p-1} (b_i - b_{m+i}) + (b_p - b_{m+p}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{p-1} (a_{1i} - a_{1,i+1}) + (a_{1p} - a_{11}) = 0\n$$\n\nand (2) is proved.\n\nConversely, if (2) holds for some $p \\in \\{2, \\dots, m\\}$ (possible not unique), we set $a_{ii} = b_i$ and $a_{i,i+1} = b_{m+i}$ for $1 \\le i \\le p-1$, $a_{p1} = b_{m+p}$. If $p < m$, we place others b's by following: $a_{i1} = b_i$, $a_{1,i} = b_{m+i}$ for $p+1 \\le i \\le m$. Using (1) we determine consecutively the missing elements in the first row and the first column $a_{21}, a_{13}, a_{31}, \\dots, a_{1p}$. It is easy to check that (1) \"completes\" the table to an equilibrium one. The Lemma is proved. $\\square$\n\nNow suppose that there exists a $m \\times m$ equilibrium table containing the numbers $2^0, 2^1, \\dots, 2^{2m-1}$. By Lemma it follows that for some $2p$ numbers among them the equality (2) holds. Dividing the both parts of the equality by the least term, we obtain an equality, where one term equals 1 and all others are even, a contradiction.\n\nb) Assume that the $m \\times m$ equilibrium table contains the numbers $2^0, 2^1, \\dots, 2^{2m-1}, k$. According to Lemma the equality (2) holds for some $2p$ numbers with $p \\in \\{2, \\dots, m\\}$. By similar to given above reasons one concludes that the number $k$ must be involved in this equality. Assume that $k = b_1$. Then $k = (b_{m+1} + \\dots + b_{m+p}) - (b_2 + \\dots + b_p)$. The maximal value of $k$ is reach for $p=m$, and it is equal to\n\n$$\nk = (2^{m-1} + \\dots + 2^{2m-2}) - (2^0 + \\dots + 2^{m-2}) = 2^{2m-1} - 2^m + 1.\n$$\n\nIn particular, for $m=2010$ we obtain $k = 2^{4019} - 2^{2010} + 1$. $\\square$",

Then there must be a positive integer that is not mapped to itself by $\\pi$.\n\nLet $i$ be the least such integer. Clearly, we have $\\pi(i) > i$. Hence there is a $j > i$ such that $\\pi(j) = i$. Consider the permutation $\\tau$ that coincides with $\\pi$ everywhere except on the numbers $i$ and $j$ where $\\tau(i) = i$ and $\\tau(j) = \\pi(i)$.\n\nThen\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} Z(\\pi) - Z(\\tau) &= a_i b_{\\pi(i)} + a_j b_{\\pi(j)} - a_i b_{\\tau(i)} - a_j b_{\\tau(j)} = a_i b_{\\pi(i)} + a_j b_i - a_i b_j - a_j b_{\\pi(i)} = \\\\ &= (a_i - a_j)(b_{\\pi(i)} - b_i) > 0 \\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(because from $i < j$ and $\\pi(i) > i$ it follows that $a_i - a_j < 0$ and $b_{\\pi(i)} - b_i < 0$).\n\nWhereas $\\pi$ is a permutation for which $Z$ takes its minimal value for all nonidentical permutations, it follows that $\\tau = \\text{id}$. This shows that $\\pi$ has the form\n\n$$\n\\pi: \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & \\dots & i-1 & i & i+1 & \\dots & j-1 & j & j+1 & \\dots & n \\\\ 1 & 2 & \\dots & i-1 & j & i+1 & \\dots & j-1 & i & j+1 & \\dots & n \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\nLet us show that $j = i + 1$. Suppose to the contrary, namely suppose that $j > i + 1$. Consider the permutation $\\sigma$ that coincides with $\\pi$ everywhere except on the numbers $i$ and $i+1$ where $\\sigma(i) = i+1$ and $\\sigma(i+1) = j$. Then $\\sigma$ is another nonidentical permutation and\n\n$$\nZ(\\pi) - Z(\\sigma) = a_i b_j + a_{i+1} b_{i+1} - a_i b_{i+1} - a_{i+1} b_j = (a_i - a_{i+1})(b_j - b_{i+1}) > 0.\n$$\n\nThus we have that $Z(\\pi) > Z(\\sigma)$. This contradicts the selection of $\\pi$, which gives the minimal value of $Z$ among all nonidentical permutations. Thus the permutation $\\pi$ is one of the following: $\\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\dots, \\pi_{n-1}$, which implies (1). The Lemma is proved. $\\square$\n\nWe shall prove that for arbitrary weights $m_1 < m_2 < \\dots < m_{n+1}$, $n \\ge 2$, one measurement is sufficient to do the job.\nLet us note that this will follow immediately if we show that there are $k_1, k_2, \\dots, k_n, k_{n+1}$\n\n$$\nk_1 m_1 + k_2 m_2 + \\dots + k_n m_n < k_{n+1} m_{n+1}, \\quad (1)\n$$\n\n$$\n\\text{and such that} \\qquad k_1 m_{\\pi(1)} + k_2 m_{\\pi(2)} + \\dots + k_n m_{\\pi(n)} > k_{n+1} m_{\\pi(n+1)} \\quad (2)\n$$\n\nfor any nonidentical permutation $\\pi$ of the set $(1, 2, \\dots, n+1)$.\n\nSuppose there are such integers.

He takes $k_{n+1}$ coins from the wagon labelled $m_{n+1}$ and puts them on the right plate. Then this measurement does the job. Indeed, if all wagons were labelled properly, the left hand side will weigh less than the right hand side, whereas otherwise it will be the right hand side that will weigh less.\n\nIt is clear that we are forced to choose and fix the integers $k_1, k_2, ..., k_n, k_{n+1}$ so that \"the second least weight\" on the left hand side exceeds the maximal weight of the right hand side, i.e. $k_{n+1}m_{n+1}$.

To show that the area of at least one of the triangles $B_0B_2B_4$, $B_1B_3B_5$ is greater than or equal to 3/2, it is sufficient to prove that the total area of the six triangles $A_{i+1}B_iA_{i+2}$ is at least 1:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{5} \\text{area } A_{i+1}B_{i}A_{i+2} \\geq 1.\n$$\n\nTo begin with, reflect each $B_i$ through the midpoint of the segment $A_{i+1}A_{i+2}$ to get the points $B'_i$. We shall prove that the six triangles $A_{i+1}B'_iA_{i+2}$ cover the hexagon. To this end, reflect $A_{2i+1}$ through the midpoint of the segment $A_{2i}A_{2i+2}$ to get the points $A'_{2i+1}$, $i=0,1,2$.

Notice first that each parallelogram $A_{2i}A_{2i+1}A_{2i+2}A'_{2i+1}$ is covered by the pair of triangles $(A_{2i}B'_{2i+5}A_{2i+1}, A_{2i+1}B'_{2i}A_{2i+2})$, $i=0,1,2$.

Similarly, $BB_1 = y(y+z)/(x+y+z)$, $BB_2 = y(y+x)/(x+y+z)$, $CC_1 = z(z+x)/(x+y+z)$ and $CC_2 = z(z+y)/(x+y+z)$.\n\nWe must show that\n\n\\[\n9 \\sum x^2(x+y)(x+z) \\geq (x+y+z)^2 \\sum (x+y)^2.\n\\]\n\nAlternatively, but equivalently,\n\n\\[\n9 \\sum x^4 + 3 \\left(\\sum x^2\\right) \\left(\\sum xy\\right) \\geq 2 \\left(\\sum x^2\\right)^2 + 4 \\left(\\sum xy\\right)^2,\n\\]\n\nwhich is a consequence of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:\n\n\\[\n3(x^4 + y^4 + z^4) \\geq (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^2\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\geq xy + yz + zx.\n\\]\n\nClearly, equality holds if and only if $x = y = z$; that is, if and only if the triangle ABC is equilateral.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/shortlistBMO_2011_p17_data_67213f28cf.png)",

A line through Y meets again $\\gamma_1$ at the point $Y_1$, and $\\gamma_2$ at the point $Y_2$. The tangent to $\\gamma_1$ at $Y_1$ meets the tangent to $\\gamma_2$ at $Y_2$ at the point Z.

Consequently, the quadrangle $X Y_1 Z Y_2$ is cyclic. It then follows that the angles $Z X Y_2$ and $Z Y_1 Y_2$ are equal, and since the latter is equal to the angle $X Y_1 Y$, we conclude that the lines XY and XZ are indeed isogonal with respect to the lines $XY_1$ and $XY_2$.\n\nIf X and Z lie on the same side of the line through Y, then the angle $Y_1 XY_2$ is the difference of the angles $X Y_1 Y$ and $X Y_2 Y$ in some order, depending on which side of the line XY the line $Y_1 Y_2$ is situated. The later angles are respectively supplementary to the angles $Y_1 Z Y$ and $Y_2 Z Y$ whose difference in the corresponding order is equal to the angle $Y_1 Z Y_2$. Consequently, the quadrangle $X Y_1 Y_2 Z$ or $X Y_2 Y_1 Z$ is cyclic.

Let $T_X, T_Y$ have scale factors $\\lambda, \\mu$ respectively. These are both positive, and the composition preserves lengths, so $\\lambda\\mu = 1$.\n\nNow choose $P'$ as an origin of Cartesian coordinates so that X, Y have coordinates $(X, 0), (0, Y)$ respectively.

Then $a!$, $(a!)!$, $\\dots$ are all fixed points of $f$, hence the function $f$ has a strictly increasing sequence $a_1 < a_2 < \\dots < a_k < \\dots$ of fixed points. For a positive integer $n$, $a_k - n$ divides $a_k - f(n) = f(a_k) - f(n)$ for every $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$. Also $a_k - n$ divides $a_k - n$, so it divides $a_k - f(n) - (a_k - n) = n - f(n)$. This is possible only if $f(n) = n$, hence in this case we get $f = \\text{id}_{\\mathbb{Z}^+}$.\n\nNow suppose that $f$ has no fixed points greater than 2. Let $p \\ge 5$ be a prime and notice that by Wilson's Theorem we have $(p-2)! \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$. Therefore $p$ divides $(p-2)! - 1$. But $(p-2)! - 1$ divides $f((p-2)!) - f(1)$, hence $p$ divides $f((p-2)!) - f(1) = (f(p-2))! - f(1)$. Clearly we have $f(1) = 1$ or $f(1) = 2$. As $p \\ge 5$, the fact that $p$ divides $(f(p-2))! - f(1)$ implies that $f(p-2) < p$. It is easy to check, again by Wilson's Theorem, that $p$ does not divide $(p-1)! - 1$ and $(p-1)! - 2$, hence we deduce that $f(p-2) \\le p-2$. On the other hand, $p-3 = (p-2)-1$ divides $f(p-2) - f(1) \\le (p-2)-1$. Thus either $f(p-2) = f(1)$ or $f(p-2) = p-2$. As $p-2 \\ge 3$, the last case is excluded, since the function $f$ has no fixed points greater than 2. It follows $f(p-2) = f(1)$ and this property holds for all primes $p \\ge 5$. Taking $n$ any positive integer, we deduce that $p-2-n$ divides $f(p-2) - f(n) = f(1) - f(n)$ for all primes $p \\ge 5$. Thus $f(n) = f(1)$, hence $f$ is the constant function 1 or 2.",

Therefore it is enough to show that, if a line segment has its ends with rational coordinates, then the foot of the perpendicular line passing through a point of the plane with rational coordinates has also rational coordinates. This really happens because the coordinates $(x, y)$ of the foot of the perpendicular are the solutions of the system $y = ax + b, y = -\\frac{1}{a}x + c$ with $a, b, c$ rational.

Subtract $a^q + b^q + c^q$ from the given equation to show that\n\n$$\na^p - a^q = b^p - b^q = c^p - c^q.\n$$\n\nNow if $p > q$ then $x^p - x^q = x^q(x^{p-q} - 1)$ is a strictly increasing function of $x > 0$, so the only way the equality can hold is if $a = b = c$. If $p < q$ then the same argument shows that $a = b = c$ also. Yet the only remaining subcase is when $p = q = r$.\n\nCase 2: two of $a, b, c$ are equal, wlog $b = c$. Subtract $b^p + b^q + b^r$ from the given equation to show that $a^p - b^p = a^q - b^q = a^r - b^r$. Exactly as in the previous case, the function of a positive integer $s$ $a^s - b^s = (a-b)(a^{s-1} + a^{s-2}2b + \\dots + a^{s-1})$ is strictly increasing, strictly decreasing or zero according as $a > b$, $a < b$ or $a = b$. In the first two subcases, this forces $p = q = r$, and in the last subcase $a = b = c$.\n\nCase 3: the $a, b, c$ are distinct, as are the $p, q, r$. Wlog $a$ is the greatest of $a, b, c$ and (cycling the variables if necessary) $p$ is the greatest of $p, q, r$. In particular, $a, p \\ge 3$. We claim that for such $a, p$ we have\n\n$$\na^p \\ge (a-1)^p + 2a^{p-1}.\n$$\n\nIndeed, since $(a-1)^p + 2a^{p-1} \\le a^{p-3}((a-1)^3 + 2ap^2)$ it suffices to prove the inequality for $p=3$, when it rearranges to the inequality $a^2 - 3a + 1 \\ge 0$.

In particular, the total number of regular hexagons equals\n\n$$\nN = \\sum_{m=1}^{n} (3(n-m)(n-m+1)+1)m = (3n^2+3n) \\sum_{m=1}^{n} m - 3(2m+1) \\sum_{m=1}^{n} m^2 + 3 \\sum_{m=1}^{n} m^3.\n$$\n\nSince $\\sum_{m=1}^{n} m = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, $\\sum_{m=1}^{n} m^2 = \\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$ and $\\sum_{m=1}^{n} m^3 = \\left(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\right)^2$ it is easily checked that $N = \\left(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\right)^2$.",

          "latex": "The crucial observation that solves this problem is that the function $f$ encodes Euclid's algorithm when we view numbers in binary. To make this precise, we will write $g(n)$ for $f(n+1)$, and consider for each integer $n$ the pair $(f(n), g(n))$. If we let $x$ be the binary string representing $n$ then the recurrence relations give us that\n\n$$\n(f(x0), g(x0)) = (f(x), f(x) + g(x)) \\text{ and } (f(x1), g(x1)) = (f(x) + g(x), g(x)).\n$$\n\nThus we can calculate the pair $(f(x), g(x))$ as follows: start from the pair $(1, 1) = (f(1), g(1))$. Now read the binary digits of $x$ from left to right, ignoring the initial 1: whenever you see a 0 add the first coordinate to the second, and whenever you see a 1 add the second coordinate to the first. For example, to calculate the pair $(f(27), g(27))$ we write $27 = 11011$ in binary, which gives us the sequence of pairs\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} (f(1), g(1)) &= (1, 1) \\\\ (f(11), g(11)) &= (2, 1) \\\\ (f(110), g(110)) &= (2, 3) \\\\ (f(1101), g(1101)) &= (5, 3) \\\\ (f(11011), g(11011)) &= (8, 3) \\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow from this it follows by induction that $(f(n), g(n))$ are coprime positive integers, with $f(n) \\ge g(n)$ if and only if $n$ is odd. To complete the proof, we just need to show that each pair $(a, b)$ of coprime positive integers arises as $(f(n), g(n))$ for a unique positive integer n. To show existence of n, imagine running Euclid's algorithm on the pair (a, b): that is to say, we successively either subtract the first coordinate from the second or the second from the first (depending on which of the two is the larger) until we can't go any further, which is when we reach the pair (1, 1). We can record this as a string consisting of a 0 for each time we subtracted the first from the second, and a 1 for each time we subtracted the second from the first. Reversing this string and prepending a 1 gives the binary expansion of a number n which (by our method of calculating (f, g)) has (f(n), g(n)) = (a, b). To get uniqueness of n we just have to note that when we ran Euclid's algorithm to construct n in the previous paragraph, we had no choices at any stage: there is a unique series of reductions that takes (a, b) to (1, 1) while remaining in positive integers. This series of reductions corresponds to a unique binary string, so the integer n we constructed was unique.",

Calling $a, b$ the number of men and women in $S$, we have $a + b = 67$.\n\nNow let $S_1$ be the set of double-votes, each having exactly one of its two corresponding single-votes in $S$, and let $S_2$ be the set of double-votes with both its single-votes in $S$. If $s_1, s_2$ are the number of elements in $S_1, S_2$ respectively, we have that the number of all double-votes with at least one single-vote in $S$ is $s_1 + s_2$, whereas the number of all double-votes with both single-votes in $S$ is $s_2 \\le ab$.\n\nSince all double-votes are distinct, there must exist at least $s_1 + s_2$ critics. But the number of all single-votes in $S$ is $s_1 + 2s_2 = 34 + 35 + \\dots + 100 = 4489$, and moreover all double-votes with both single-votes in $S$ is $s_2$. So there exist at least $s_1 + s_2 = s_1 + 2s_2 - s_2 \\ge 4489 - ab$ critics.\n\nNow notice that as $a+b=67$, the maximum value of $ab$ with $a,b$ integers is obtained for $\\{a,b\\} = \\{33,34\\}$, so $ab \\le 33 \\cdot 34 = 1122$. A quick proof of this is the following: $ab = \\frac{(a+b)^2 - (a-b)^2}{4} = \\frac{67^2 - (a-b)^2}{4}$ which is maximized (for integer $a,b$) whenever $|a-b|=1$, thus for $\\{a,b\\} = \\{33,34\\}$.\n\nThus there exist at least $4489 - 1122 = 3367$ critics which is a contradiction and we are done. $\\square$",

If $a = a_1, \\dots, a_{2^n}$ is a sequence of integers, then we will denote by $Q(a)_j$ the $j$th question that Jeremy asks, and $A(a)_j$ the $j$th answer that Isaac gives, when Isaac chooses the sequence $k_i = a_i$. $Q(a)_j$ is allowed to depend on $Q(a)_1, \\dots, Q(a)_{j-1}$ and $A(a)_1, \\dots, A(a)_{j-1}$, but not on anything else.\n\nWe want to show that, irrespective of Jeremy's strategy for determining the questions $Q$, there are two sequences $a$ and $b$ of integers such that $b_1, \\dots, b_{2^n}$ are distinct, $a_1, \\dots, a_{2^n}$ are not distinct, and $A(a)_j = A(b)_j$ for all $j$. This ensures that $Q(a)_j = Q(b)_j$ for all $j$. In words, if Isaac picks either the sequence $k_i = a_i$ or $k_i = b_i$ then Jeremy asks the same questions and gets the same answers. Thus in these two cases, Jeremy cannot determine whether Isaac's sequence consists of distinct integers, as desired.\n\nWe dispense with the trivial case $n=1$ by hand, and henceforth assume $n > 1$.\n\nTo construct the sequences, consider sequences $d = d_1, \\dots, d_{2^n}$ which are permutations of $1, \\dots, 2^n$ (which automatically consist of distinct integers). There are $(2^n)!$ such sequences. Yet there are only $2^{2^{2^{n-1}}} < (2^n)!$ (we will justify the inequality later) possible sequences $A(d)_1, \\dots, A(d)_{n2^{n-1}}$ of answers, so that there are two distinct sequences $b$ and $c$ which are permutations of $1, \\dots, 2^n$ and such that $A(b)_j = A(c)_j$ for all $j$. As above, this means that $Q(b)_j = Q(c)_j$ for all $j$.\n\nWe now want to construct the sequence $a$ so that $A(a)_j = A(b)_j$ for all $j$, but $a_1, \\dots, a_{2^n}$ are not all distinct. To do this, note that there must be indices $i_1$ and $i_2$ such that $b_{i_2} = b_{i_1} + 1$ but $c_{i_2} < c_{i_1}$ since $b$ and $c$ are distinct permutations of $1, \\dots, 2^n$. We now define $a$ by\n\n$$\na_i = \\begin{cases} b_i & \\text{if } i \\neq i_2 \\\\ b_{i_1} & \\text{if } i = i_2 \\end{cases}\n$$\n\nNow $a_{i_2} = b_{i_1} = a_{i_1}$ so that the integers $a_1, \\dots, a_{2^n}$ are not all distinct. Moreover, $a$ and $b$ give the same answers to all questions except the question \"is $k_{i_2} > k_{i_1}$?\", which is true for $b$ but false for $a$ and $c$. Since the questions $Q(b)_j = Q(c)_j$ receive the same answers for the sequences $b$ and $c$, it follows that none of them can be the question \"is $k_{i_2} > k_{i_1}$?\". Hence $a$ gives the same answers to the questions $Q(b)_j$ as $b$ does, so that by a quick induction we have $Q(a)_j = Q(b)_j$ and $A(a)_j = A(b)_j$ for all $j$ (Jeremy must ask the same questions and get the same answers).\n\nThus, as desired we have found sequences $a$ and $b$ with $b_1, \\dots, b_{2^n}$ distinct and $a_1, \\dots, a_{2^n}$ not distinct, so that $A(a)_j = A(b)_j$ for all $j$. This completes the proof, provided we justify the inequality $2^{n2^{n-1}} < (2^n)!$ for $n > 1$ used above:\n\nWe proceed by induction. The base case $n=2$ is just calculation, and for higher $n$ we just need to note that $\\frac{(2^n)!}{(2^{n-1})!}$ is a product of $2^{n-1}$ terms, each of which is greater than $2^{n-1}$ and so $(2^n)! > (2^{n-1})^{2^{n-1}}(2^{n-1})!$. Combining this with the inductive hypothesis gives that $(2^n)! > 2^{(n-1)2^{n-1}+(n-1)2^{n-2}} \\ge 2^{n2^{n-1}}$ since $n \\ge 3$. $\\square$",

From now on consider a $kn \\times kn$ board tiled with $1 \\times n$ tiles ($n \\ge 2$), with $k > 1$ fixed.\n\nFor a lower bound of $N$, divide the board into $k^2$ squares of size $n \\times n$ and notice that if one of them, say $P$, does not contain some one of the $N$ chosen cells, then there exist two tilings which differ on $P$ but agree on the rest of the board, and the given tiling would never be uncovered. Thus we must have $k^2 \\le N$.\n\nFor an upper bound of $N$, consider the $k^2$ in number lower-left cells in each one of the squares of size $n \\times n$ considered above, and learn the position of the tiles that cover these cells. We shall show by induction on $n$ that this procedure allows you to figure out the complete tiling. Thus $N \\le k^2$. This, together with $k^2 \\le N$ prove above would imply $N = k^2$, and we'll have finished.\n\nFor the induction argue as follows:\n\nFor $n = 2$, suppose that there are two tilings $A$ and $B$ that agree on all lower-left cells of the $n \\times n = 2 \\times 2$ squares considered above, but differ on some other cell $a_1$ of the given board. We'll arrive at a contradiction, which will mean any tiling can be uncovered by choosing to learn the positions of these lower-left cells, as wanted. Indeed:\n\nLet $d_1$ be the $1 \\times n = 1 \\times 2$ domino which covers $a_1$ in $A$. Colour in red the upper-right cell in each $2 \\times 2$ square; without loss of generality, $a_1$ is a red cell (otherwise, replace $a_1$ by the other cell covered by $d_1$). Let $d_2$ be the $1 \\times n = 1 \\times 2$ domino which covers $a_1$ in $B$, $b_1$ be the second cell covered by $d_2$, $d_3$ be the domino which covers $b_1$ in $A$, $a_2$ be the second cell covered by $d_3$, et cetera. Then $a_i$ is red for all $i$.\n\nLet $s$ be the least positive integer such that there exists a $t < s$ such that $a_s = a_t$; clearly, we must have $t = 1$. Consider the polyomino $P$ enclosed by the sequence of cells $a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, \\dots, b_{s-1}$, $a_s = a_1$.\n\nLet $O_i$ be the centre of $a_i$. It is straightforward to verify that $S(P) = S(O_1O_2\\dots O_{s-1}) - s + 2$ (where $S(\\cdot)$ denotes area). Since $O_1O_2\\dots O_{s-1}$ is a polyomino in the grid formed by the centres of all red cells, its area $S(O_1O_2\\dots O_{s-1})$ is a multiple of four and the number $s-1$ of its sides is even. It follows from this that $S(P)$ is odd whereas it must be possible to tile $P$ with dominoes; the desired contradiction.\n\nFor the inductive step, let $n \\ge 3$. Number all columns as 1 through $kn$ from left to right and all rows as 1 through $kn$ from bottom to top, and delete all rows and columns whose number is congruent to $2$ modulo $n$. This operation produces a $k(n-1) \\times k(n-1)$ chessboard tiled with $1 \\times (n-1)$ tiles. By the induction hypothesis, we can reconstruct this tiling completely by choosing to uncover the lower-left cells of the $(n-1) \\times (n-1)$ squares in which we divide this $k(n-1) \\times k(n-1)$ chessboard. These cells are exactly the lower-left cells of the $n \\times n$ squares in which we divide the original $kn \\times kn$ chessboard. Restore all deleted rows and columns, and you have the positions of all tiles in the original tiling that were not contained within a deleted row or column. Repeat the operation for all rows and columns whose numbers are congruent to $3$ modulo $n$, and you have the positions of those tiles as well, using the same lower-left cells of the $n \\times n$ squares in which we divide the original $kn \\times kn$ chessboard. So choosing to learn the positions of the tiles covering these cells you uncover the whole tiling of the original $kn \\times kn$ chessboard, as wanted to prove. $\\square$\n\n**Remark (P.S.C.).** After defining the potentially existed cells $a_i, b_i$, the above solution should be expanded as follows: (1) considering the possibility that the sequence $a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, \\dots$ may not close, but rather arrive at an edge of the original matrix, (2) explaining that if $a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, \\dots$ closes, $a_i, b_i, a_{i+1}$ should be seen as neighboring cells in a row or in a column, and from this to deduce the remarks about the areas, which is not as short a task as it seems in a first glance. $\\square$",

We can easily check those solutions.\n\n**Step 1:** The number $x^3 + y^3$ has at most one odd prime divisor. Let $p_1 < p_2 < \\cdots < p_k$ the odd prime divisors of $x^3 + y^3$ with $k \\ge 2$. Then the numbers $p_1$ and $p_2 \\cdots p_k$ are relatively prime divisors of $x^3 + y^3$. Thus, $N_1 = p_1 + (p_2 \\cdots p_k) - 1$ is divisor of $x^3 + y^3$. Because, $N_1$ is odd, we have that\n\n$$\nN_1 = p_1^{r_1} \\cdots p_k^{r_k}\n$$\n\nfor some natural numbers $r_1, \\dots, r_k$. But, for $i \\ge 2$, the number $p_i$ can't be a divisor of $N_1$ since then $p_i$ would been a divisor of $p_1 - 1$, which is a contradiction, because $p_i > p_1$.\n\nTherefore, $N_1 = p_1^{m_1}$ and $m_1 > 1$ since $N_1 > p_1$. Additionally, the number\n\n$$\nN_2 = p_1^2 + (p_2 \\cdots p_k) - 1,\n$$\n\nis also divisor of $x^3 + y^3$. A similar argument as above gives us that $N_2 = p_1^{m_2}$. So, we have that\n\n$$\np_1^{m_2} - p_1^{m_1} = N_2 - N_1 = p_1^2 - p_1.\n$$\n\nOf course we have that $m_2 > m_1$ but, this one gives us\n\n$$\np_1^{m_2} - p_1^{m_1} \\ge p_1^{m_1}(p_1 - 1) \\ge p_1(p_1 - 1) = p_1^2 - p_1,\n$$\n\nwhere the equality holds if and only if $m_1 = 1, m_2 = 2$. But we have already seen that $m_1 > 1$ so we reach to a contradiction and thus $x^3 + y^3$ has actually one the most odd prime divisor.\n\n**Step 2:** The number $x^3 + y^3$ has at most one prime divisor.\n\nSuppose that this is not the case, then from the first step $x^3 + y^3$ has exactly two prime divisors, the number 2 and some odd prime number $p$.\n\nThen, $2+p-1 = p+1$ divides $x^3+y^3$. Since $(p,p+1)=1$, as in the first step, $p+1$ has to be a power of 2, thus 4 divides $x^3+y^3$. Furthermore, $4+p-1 = p+3$ also divides $x^3+y^3$. But this means that if $p \\ne 3$ then $p+3$ is also a power of 2. But if $p > 3$, then $p+1, p+3$ cannot be both powers of 2. Therefore, $p=3$, and $x^3+y^3 = 2^a \\cdot 3^b$ for some positive integers $a, b$.\n\nIf $a \\ge 3$, then $8|x^3 + y^3$ so $8+3-1=10$ divides $x^3 + y^3$, which is a contradiction.\n\nIf $b \\ge 2$, then $9|x^3 + y^3$, so again $9+2-1=10$ divides $x^3 + y^3$, which is again a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, $x^3 + y^3 \\in \\{6, 12\\}$ but the last one has no solutions.\n\nBy using the Steps 1 and 2, we have only to solve the equation\n\n$$\nx^3 + y^3 = p^a, \\qquad (15)\n$$\n\nwhere $p$ is a prime number and $a$ is a positive integer.

We observe that there are no 46 people with the required property.\n\nNow we show that $k = 45$ can be achieved: Suppose that customers $C_1, C_2, \\dots, C_{2016}$ visited the shop in this order. (If two or more customers entered the shop at exactly the same time then we break ties arbitrarily.)\n\nWe define groups $A_1, A_2, \\dots$ of customers as follows: Starting with $C_1$ and proceeding in order, we place customer $C_j$ into the group $A_i$ where $i$ is the smallest index such that $A_i$ contains no customer $C_{j'}$ with $j' < j$ and such that $C_{j'}$ was inside the shop once $C_j$ entered it.\n\nClearly no two customers who are in the same group were inside the shop at the exact same time. So we may assume that every $A_i$ has at most 45 customers. Since $44 \\cdot 45 < 2016$, by the pigeonhole principle there must be at least 45 (non-empty) groups.\n\nLet $C_j$ be a person in group $A_{45}$ and suppose that $C_j$ entered the shop at time $t_j$.

This is immediate if $p$ divides $m$ as all $a_k$'s are multiples of $p^{r_p}$.

This works because if $P(x)$ had degree less than $n$, then looking at the values $P(1), \\dots, P(n)$ we would get that $P(x)$ is constant. But this is impossible as $P(0) \\ne P(1)$.\n\nNote. Looking at the coefficient of $x^n$ in the definition of $P(x)$ it is not difficult to see that if we fix any $t_1, \\dots, t_n$ and pick $t_0$ large enough we will get that this coefficient is non-zero.

Then, J(Z) = X, J(D) = Y and J(E) = W. Therefore, the circumcircle (C₁) of the triangle ABC is the image of the circle (ω) under the inversion J. Thus, the circle of inversion J passes through the points I, L.\n\nWe conclude that HI = HL and HIₐ \\perp IL and since (δ) || IL, we have HIₐ \\perp (δ).\n\nIf, R is the point of intersection of the lines (δ), HL, we get that quadrilateral HRIₐG is parallelogram and its diagonals meet each other at the point T. So, the perpendicular line (e) through the point N to the line BC and the parallel line (δ) through the point G to the line IL, meet each other on the line HIₐ.",

The circumcircle contains the vertices, so $r(A, B, C)$ is not greater than the circumradius. Now, let us prove that no smaller circle contains all three vertices. If there is a smaller circle, let its center be $P$. Further, let the circumcenter be $O$. Since $ABC$ is acute, $O$ is in the interior. Consider the line that passes through $O$ and is parallel to $BC$. Let us call it $l_A$ and define $l_B$ and $l_C$ similarly. Now, consider the set of points that are on the opposite side of $l_A$ with respect to $A$. Call this set $S_A$ and define $S_B$ and $S_C$ similarly. It is easily seen (by geometry) that $S_A \\cap S_B \\cap S_C = \\emptyset$. As such, assume $P \\notin S_A$ without loss of generality. That is to say, $P$ is on the same side of $l_A$ as $A$. Now, consider the perpendicular bisector of $BC$ and assume that $P$, w.l.o.g, is on the same side of this line as $C$. Under these circumstances, $|PB| \\ge |OB|$. Thus, the smaller circle centered at $P$ must exclude $B$.\n\nIn the obtuse case, let $\\angle BAC \\ge 90^\\circ$. Then $BC$ is the longest side. The circle with diameter $BC$ contains all three vertices. Therefore, $r(A, B, C)$ is not greater than $\\frac{1}{2}|BC|$. But any smaller circle will clearly exclude at least one of $B$ and $C$. ■\n\nNow, let us return to the original problem. Note that there must be points $A, B, C$ among $A_1, A_2, ..., A_n$ such that the circumcircle of $ABC$ contains all $n$ points. One can see this as follows: First start with a large circle that contains all $n$ points. Then shrink it while keeping the center fixed, until one of the $n$ points is on the circle and call this point $A$. Then shrink it keeping the point $A$ in place and moving the center closer to $A$, until another point $B$ is on the circle. Then keep the line $AB$ fixed while moving the center toward it or away from it so that another $C$ among the $n$ points appears on the circle. It is easy to see that this procedure is doable.\n\nConsider all such triples $A, B, C$ such that the circumcircle of $ABC$ contains all of $A_1, A_2, ..., A_n$. Now choose the one among them with the smallest circumradius and let it be $A_i, A_j, A_k$. If $A_i A_j A_k$ is an acute triangle, any smaller circle will exclude one of $A_i, A_j, A_k$ by the lemma above. Therefore,\n\n$$\nr(A_1, A_2, ..., A_n) = \\text{circumradius of } A_i A_j A_k = r(A_i, A_j, A_k).\n$$\n\nIf $A_i A_j A_k$ is an obtuse triangle, let $A_i$ be its obtuse angle. We wish to prove that the circle with diameter $A_j A_k$ contains all $n$ points. This will mean that\n\n$$\nr(A_1, A_2, ..., A_n) = \\frac{1}{2} |A_j A_k| = r(A_i, A_j, A_k)\n$$\n\nand we will be done. If there are no points on the opposite side of $A_j A_k$ w.r.t. $A_i$, then this assertion is clear. If there are some points on that side, choose the one $X$ such that $\\angle A_j X A_k$ is smallest possible. Then the circumcircle of $A_j X A_k$ contains all $n$ points. However, by the choice of $A_i$, the circumradius of $A_j X A_k$ cannot be less than that of $A_i A_j A_k$. Thus, $\\angle A_j X A_k \\ge \\angle A_j A_i A_k \\ge 90^\\circ$. As such, the circle with diameter $A_j A_k$ contains all $n$ points.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/short_list_BMO_2017_p20_data_8aba4a7d90.png)\n\nFigure 1: The circumcircles of $A_i A_j A_k$ and $A_j X A_k$ as well as the circle with diameter $A_j A_k$ are shown.\n\n**Remark.** The problem selection committee recommended formulation of the task to improve.",

In this case we will show that any distribution of candies is legal. Thus the number of legal distributions is indeed $\\binom{2n-1}{n}$.\n\nIn this case we can achieve the above claim by letting each student to always distribute all of its candies to its two neighbouring students in some way. Thus at each step each candy will move either one position clockwise or one anticlockwise.\n\nWe now look at the initial distribution of candies and the required final distribution. We specify arbitrarily for each candy in the initial distribution, the position we wish this candy to end up in the required final distribution. Because $n$ is odd, either the clockwise distance or the anticlockwise distance between the initial position of the candy and the required final position is even and at most $m$.\n\nThus after an even number of steps (at most $m$) we can move each candy to its required final position. (Note that if the candy reaches the required position earlier, we can move it back and forth until all candies reach their required position.) This completes the proof of our claim in this case.\n\nCase 2. Suppose $n$ is even, say $n=2m$. Let $x_1, \\dots, x_{2m}$ be the students in this cyclic order.\n\nObserve that initially the students with even indices (even students) have at least one candy in total, and so do the students with odd indices (odd students). This property is preserved after each step.\n\nWe will show that every distribution in which the even students have at least one candy in total and the odd students also have at least one candy in total is legal.\n\nLet us suppose that the required final distribution has $a$ candies in odd positions and $b$ candies in even positions. (Where $a, b \\ge 1$.) It will be enough to reach any position with $a$ candies in even positions and $b$ candies in odd positions as then we can follow the same approach as in Case 1.\n\nTo achieve this we will first move all candies to students $x_1$ and $x_2$. This is easy by specifying that at each step $x_1$ moves all of its candies to $x_2$ while for $1 \\le r \\le 2m-1$ student $x_{r+1}$ moves all of its candies to $x_r$.\n\nSuppose that we now have $a+k$ candies at $x_1$ and $b-k$ candies at $x_2$ where without loss of generality $k \\ge 0$. If $k=0$ we have reached our target. If not, in the next step $x_1$ moves a candy to $x_2$ and $x_2$ moves a candy to $x_3$. In the next step $x_1$ (it still has $a+k-1 \\ge a > 0$ candies) moves a candy to $x_2$, $x_2$ moves a candy to $x_1$ and $x_3$ moves a candy to $x_2$. We now have $a+k-1$ candies in $x_1$ and $b+1-k$ in $x_2$. Repeating this process another $k-1$ times we end up with $a$ candies in $x_1$ and $b$ candies in $x_2$ as required.\n\nIt remains to count the total number of legal configurations in this case. This is indeed equal to\n\n\\[\n\\binom{2n-1}{n} - 2\\binom{3n-1}{n}\n\\]\n\nas $\\binom{2n-1}{n}$ counts the total number of configurations while $\\binom{3n-1}{n}$ counts the number of illegal configurations where either all $n$ candies belong to the $\\frac{n}{2}$ odd positions or all $n$ candies belong to the $\\frac{n}{2}$ even positions.",

Consider a convex 101-gon such that one of its vertices is at $P$ and the remaining 100 vertices are within $\\varepsilon$ of $Q$ where $\\varepsilon$ is an arbitrarily small positive real. Let $k+l$ equal the total number $\\frac{101\\cdot 98}{2} = 4949$ of diagonals. When $k \\le 4851$, the sum of the $k$ shortest diagonals is arbitrarily small. When $k \\ge 4851$, the sum of the $k$ shortest diagonals is arbitrarily close to $k-4851 = 98-l$ and the sum of the remaining diagonals is arbitrarily close to $l$. Therefore, we need to have $l \\le 49$ and $k \\ge 4900$.\n\nWe proceed to show that $k=4900$ works. To this end, colour all $l=49$ remaining diagonals green. To each green diagonal AB, apart from, possibly, the last one, we will assign two red diagonals AC and CB so that no green diagonal is ever coloured red and no diagonal is coloured red twice.\n\nSuppose that we have already done this for $0 \\le i \\le 48$ green diagonals (thus forming $i$ red-red-green triangles) and let AB be up next. Let $D$ be the set of all diagonals emanating from A or B and distinct from AB: we have $|D|=2\\cdot 97=194$. Every red-red-green triangle formed thus far has at most two sides in $D$. Therefore, the subset $E$ of all as-of-yet-uncoloured diagonals in $D$ contains at least $194-2i$ elements.\n\nWhen $i \\le 47$, $194-2i \\ge 100$. The total number of endpoints distinct from A and B of diagonals in $D$, however, is 99. Therefore, two diagonals in $E$ have a common endpoint C and we can assign AC and CB to AB, as needed.\n\nThe case $i=48$ is slightly more tricky: this time, it is possible that no two diagonals in $E$ have a common endpoint other than A and B, but, if so, then there are two diagonals in $E$ that intersect in a point interior to both. Otherwise, at least one (say, $a$) of the two vertices adjacent to A is cut off from B by the diagonals emanating from A and at least one (say, $b$) of the two vertices adjacent to B is cut off from A by the diagonals emanating from B (and $a \\ne b$). This leaves us with at most 97 suitable endpoints and at least 98 diagonals in $E$, a contradiction.\n\nBy the triangle inequality, this completes the solution.",

          "latex": "$N$ odd. In fact, the number of trajectories has the same parity as $N$.\n\nThe setting is a (multi)graph where every vertex has degree three. Each vertex has an *orientation*, an ordering of its incident edges. We call Vlad's possible paths *trajectories*, and a *complete trajectory* if he traverses every edge in both directions. We may assume the multigraph is connected, as otherwise a complete trajectory is certainly not possible.\n\n**N odd (construction):** There is an example when $N = 1$, as shown in Figure 10.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/2019_bmo_shortlist_p36_data_bd2a01040b.png)\n\nFigure 10: C4: $N = 1$\n\nThere are two 3-regular graphs on two vertices, the *handcuffs* and *theta*. The handcuffs fail since each self-loop has its own trajectory, but the theta does work for two of the four possible orientations.\n\nWe now construct examples for $N \\ge 3$ odd by induction. Suppose we have a valid 3-regular graph on $2(N-2)$ vertices, such that Vlad's trajectory is complete. This has at least two (undirected) edges, so pick two of them, $e$ and $e'$. (It *does not matter* if they share incident vertices.) Split both $e$ and $e'$ into three, by adding two new vertices to each, and connect as in Figure 11.\n\nNew vertices have degree three; other degrees are unchanged, so the graph is still 3-regular. For each edge $e$ and $e'$, pick a direction. (Both *up* in the figure.) These directed edges are part of the complete trajectory given by the induction hypothesis. Choose the orientations of the new vertices to preserve these two sections of the trajectory. The remaining two directed edges in the original graph will end up as partial trajectories in the new graph (see Figure 11).\n\nHowever, because all the new partial trajectories start and finish at the same places and in the same directions in the original graph, and no other directed edges are changed, the trajectory remains complete. The result for $N$ odd follows by induction.\n\n**N even:** Split each edge $e$ in the graph into two directed edges $\\overrightarrow{e}$ and $\\overrightarrow{e'}$. Let $D$ be the set of the $6N$ directed edges. Let $\\alpha$ be the permutation of $D$ which exchanges $\\overrightarrow{e}$ and $\\overrightarrow{e'}$.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/2019_bmo_shortlist_p37_data_5f00f75eb6.png)\n\nFigure 11: C4: Trajectories in the old and new graphs\n\nand $\\vec{e}$.\n\nNow, for each roundabout $v$, let $\\vec{e}_1, \\vec{e}_2, \\vec{e}_3$ be the three directed edges into $v$. The roundabout has a cyclic orientation, either $(\\vec{e}_1, \\vec{e}_2, \\vec{e}_3)$ or $(\\vec{e}_1, \\vec{e}_3, \\vec{e}_2)$. Let $\\theta(\\vec{e}_1)$ describe the directed edge after $\\vec{e}_1$ in this orientation. By considering all roundabouts, $\\theta$ is also a permutation of $D$.\n\nNote that $\\theta(\\vec{e}_1)$ is directed towards $v$, so the directed edge after $\\vec{e}_1$ in a trajectory is $\\alpha(\\theta(\\vec{e}_1))$. So Vlad makes a complete trajectory precisely if $\\alpha\\theta$ is a cyclic permutation of $D$. Note that the cycle type of $\\theta$ is $(3, 3, \\dots, 3)$, and the cycle type of $\\alpha$ is $(2, 2, \\dots, 2)$. So $\\theta$ is always an even permutation, while $\\alpha$ is an even permutation precisely when $N$ is even.\n\nHowever, a cyclic permutation of $D$ is always odd, since $|D| = 6N$ is even. So there is certainly no complete trajectory when $N$ is even. $\\square$\n\n**Alternative I:** We claim that in a graph with $E$ edges, and $V$ vertices, the number of trajectories, $T$, has the same parity as $V + E$. We allow degenerate cases of this statement, for example graphs that are disconnected, or trajectories that consist of only a single vertex, so that the graph that consists of $V$ vertices and no edges has precisely $V$ trajectories, and thus satisfies the given claim. This shows that $N$ cannot be even.\n\nWe prove the claim by induction on $E$. Suppose we are given a graph with $E \\ge 1$ edges and $T$ trajectories. Then consider any edge $e$, and its two directions $\\vec{e}, \\leftarrow e$. Let $A$ be the sequence of directed edges starting from the one after $\\vec{e}$ in its trajectory, ending at the edge before $\\leftarrow e$ or $\\vec{e}$, whichever appears first. Similarly define $B$ starting after $\\leftarrow e$. $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, and may be empty.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/2019_bmo_shortlist_p37_data_c2153f07f0.png)\n\nFigure 12: C4: (a) Initial trajectories. (b) After removing $e$.\n\nWe consider removing $e$, but otherwise keep the orientations at its incident vertices the same. Then if $\\vec{e}, \\leftarrow e$ are in different trajectories, these are the concatenations $(\\vec{e}, A)$ and $(\\leftarrow e, B)$. After removing $e$, for each direction $\\vec{e}, \\leftarrow e$, instead of proceeding onto this directed edge, the relevant trajectory moves to the other trajectory. In other words, the resulting trajectory is the concatenation $(A, B)$. So $T$ decreases by one.\n\nSimilarly, if both directions of $e$ are part of the same trajectory, this is the concatenation $(\\vec{e}, A, \\overleftarrow{e}, B)$. Then when we remove $e$, this splits into the two trajectories $(A)$ and $(B)$, by an essentially identical argument. So $T$ increases by one. Thus in both cases, removing one edge changes the parity of $T$, and so the claim follows by induction on $E$.\n\nIn the original setting we have $V = 2N$, $E = 3N$, so $T$ must have the same parity as $5N$. Thus $T = 1$ is impossible when $N$ is even. $\\square$\n\n**Alternative II:** An alternative is to induct on $N$, using the following stronger claim.\n\n*Claim:* You can't have exactly one trajectory for $N$ even; nor exactly two trajectories for a connected graph with $N$ odd.\n\n*Proof of claim:* We have to check that the claim is true for $N=1,2$. Checking $N=2$ requires a couple of case. Alternatively, one can argue that a single cyclic edge with no vertices (!) counts as the case $N=0$. Now use strong induction by contradiction. If $N$ is even, but has exactly one trajectory, then there are no self-loops, so pick any edge $e$, connecting vertices $v \\neq w$. Remove $e$, then remove $v$, and connect $v$'s other two incident edges (which are distinct from each other and $e$) to form a single edge. Do the same for $w$.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/2019_bmo_shortlist_p38_data_37b53fd999.png)\n\nFigure 13: C4: Trajectories in the old and new graphs\n\nThe effect on the trajectories is shown in Figure 13. Note that the new graph is still 3-regular. We then argue as in Proof I that this operation splits the trajectory into two. So if the new graph is connected, this contradicts the hypothesis for $N-1$. Alternately, the new graph might consist of two components. Since it is 3-regular, each component has an even number of vertices. The total number of vertices is $2(N-1)$, which is 2 modulo 4, and so one of the components has a number of vertices which is a multiple of four, and a complete trajectory of this component, which also contradicts the induction hypothesis.\n\nNow suppose $N$ is odd, but the original oriented graph has exactly two trajectories. If there is a self-loop at some vertex $v$, then one of the trajectories involves only this self-loop. So remove this vertex, and consider the other vertex $w$ connected to $v$. Remove $w$ and join up its other two incident edges. The resulting graph corresponds to $N$ even, and has a complete trajectory, which is a contradiction.\n\nOtherwise, there are no self-loops, but the graph is connected hence there must be one edge $e$ connecting vertices $v \\neq w$ which has one trajectory in one direction, and the other trajectory in the other direction. Collapse this edge as in Figure 13, and again by the same argument as in Proof I, this merges the two trajectories, giving a complete trajectory for $N$ even, and a contradiction. $\\square$",
