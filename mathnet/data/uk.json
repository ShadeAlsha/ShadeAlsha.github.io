Without loss of generality, we can draw things in the configuration shown below.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/V_Britanija_2006_p12_data_b49788325e.png)\n\nWe must prove that the area of $ABFE$ is equal to the area of $CDEF$. But we know that the area of $ABC$ is equal to the area of $ADC$, so we just need to show that the area of $AXE$ is equal to the area of $CXF$.\n\nNow, $AX = XC$ (the diagonals bisect each other), $\\vec{AX} = \\vec{CX}$ (vertically opposite angles) and $\\vec{EA} = \\vec{FCX}$ (alternate angles between parallel lines). Thus $\\triangle AEX$ and $\\triangle CFX$ are congruent (angle-side-angle). So in particular, they have the same area, as needed to be proved.\n\nThe point $X$ must be inside the quadrilateral, as otherwise we could draw a line through $X$, parallel to one of the sides, which does not intersect the quadrilateral at all, and this would clearly not divide it into equal areas.\n\nNow, the area of $ADVW$ equals the area of $ADYZ$, and the area of $BEVW$ equals the area of $BEYZ$. By removing the large common areas, this implies that the area of $ABX$ is equal to the area of $DEX$, and thus that $\\frac{1}{2}ab \\sin AXB = \\frac{1}{2}de \\sin DXE$. Also, $AXB = DXE$ (vertically opposite angles). Thus $ab = dc$.\n\nSimilarly, $bc = ef$ and $ac = df$.\n\nMultiplying the first two of these, we get $ab^2c = de^2f$. Then, by the last of them, $b^2 = e^2$. Thus $b = e$. Similarly, we get $a = d$ and $c = f$.\n\nHence $\\triangle AXB \\equiv \\triangle DXE$ (side-angle-side). This means that $XAB = XDE$, so WZ is parallel to VY.\n\nSimilarly, WV is parallel to ZY, so WYVZ is a parallelogram.",

Thus $n^2(n^2 + 16)$ is divisible by $2^4$, as $n^4$ and $16n^2$ both are.\n\nOne of $n, n-1$ and $n+1$ is divisible by 3. However, $n-1$ and $n+1$ are prime, so $n$ must be divisible by 3 (again, since $n > 6$). Therefore $n^2(n^2 + 16)$ is divisible by 9, as $n^2$ is.\n\nOne of $n-2, n-1, n, n+1$ and $n+2$ is divisible by 5. However, $n-1$ and $n+1$ are prime, and $n > 6$, so it is neither of these. Thus $(n-2)n(n+2) = n^3 - 4n$ is a multiple of 5. Hence $n(n^3 - 4n)$ is also a multiple of 5.\n\nSince $20n^2$ is clearly also divisible by 5, so is $n^4 - 4n^2 + 20n^2 = n^2(n^2 + 16)$. Thus $n^2(n^2 + 16)$ is a multiple of $2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 = 720$.\n\nThe converse, \"If $n^2(n^2 + 16)$ is divisible by 720, then $n-1$ and $n+1$ are prime\" is not true.\n\nFor example, if $n = 78$, then $78^2(78^2 + 16)$ is divisible by 720.

Firstly, $g(1) = f(1)/1 = 1$, which is an integer.\n\nSuppose $g(1), \\dots, g(a)$ are all integers. Now, if $a+1 = 2b$ is even, $g(a+1) = g(2b) = g(b)$, an integer. Similarly, if $a+1 = 2b+1$ is odd, $g(a+1) = g(2b+1) = g(b) + 1$ is an integer. This completes the induction step.\n\nNow, since $f(n) = ng(n)$, and $g(n)$ is always an integer, so is $f(n)$.\n\nFor part (ii), we notice that $f(n) = 2n$ if and only if $g(n) = 2$.\n\nWriting $n = 2^ka$ where $a$ is odd, the equation $g(n) = 2$ becomes $g(2^ka) = g(a) = 2$ by repeated use of the recurrence relation $g(2n) = g(n)$.\n\nSince $a$ is odd, we can write $a = 2m + 1$. Here $m \\ge 1$, as $g(1) \\ne 2$. So\n$$g(a) = g(2m + 1) = 2 \\text{ implies } g(m) = 1.$$\n\nWe repeat this analysis, writing $m = 2^x y$, with $y$ odd. Then $g(m) = g(2^x y) = g(y) = 1$.

It has volume given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{vmatrix} x & y & z \\\\ y & z & x \\\\ z & x & y \\end{vmatrix} = |3xyz - x^3 - y^3 - z^3| = 1.\n$$\n\nBut the volume of a parallelepiped is at most the product of the lengths of all the sides which start at a given vertex, with equality if and only if it is a cuboid. In this case, all the sides starting at the origin have length $(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^{1/2}$.\n\nTherefore $(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^{3/2} \\ge 1$, so $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\ge 1$, with equality if and only if the sides are mutually perpendicular. This will occur when $(x, y, z) \\cdot (y, z, x) = 0$, which is the same as $xy + yz + zx = 0$.",

If it crosses an axis, then clearly one crossing point on that axis must be positive and one negative.\n\nIt is quite easy to establish between which two integers the crossing-point lies, say on the positive side of the $x$-axis. We can do this by interval bisection. The crossing point can be at most 4016: for simplicity, it is certainly less than $4096 = 2^{12}$.\n\nWe ask the question for (2048, 0) and so on, bisecting until we find the two lattice points between which the circle cuts the axis.\n\nSince we are bisecting an interval of size $2^{12}$, this requires 12 questions.\n\nIf we do this for each half-axis, we will get 4 intervals of length 1 through which the circle passes. This determines both coordinates of the centre of the circle to within 1.\n\nThis has used 48 questions, 12 for each half-axis. We can use the remaining questions to further bisect these intervals, until we know the centre lies in a square of length $1/8$.\n\nWe know the position of the centre to within a square of size $1/8$. Let $h$ be the distance from this square to the $x$-axis; so the centre has $y$-coordinate between $h$ and $h + 1/8$.\n\nConsider the one of the intersections with the $x$-axis; we know this lies within an interval of size $1/8$. So we know the difference of $x$-coordinate between this intersection and the centre to within $(1/8 + 1/8) = 1/4$. We let $w$ be the minimum value of this distance: see the diagram overleaf.\n\nWe can now calculate the radius $r$.\n\nFrom the diagram we see that\n\n\\[\nh^2 + w^2 \\le r^2 \\le \\left(h + \\frac{1}{8}\\right)^2 + \\left(w + \\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2,\n\\]\n\nand thus\n\n\\[\nh^2 + w^2 \\le r^2 \\le h^2 + w^2 + \\frac{h}{4} + \\frac{w}{2} + \\frac{5}{64}.\n\\]\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/V_Britanija_2008_p25_data_8d57075cc9.png)\n\nWe know that $w$ and $h$ are both positive, and less than or equal to $r$. Let us write $r_0$ for the maximum possible value of $r$:\n\n\\[\nr_0^2 = \\left(h + \\frac{1}{8}\\right)^2 + \\left(w + \\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\nWe have an ambiguity if\n\n\\[\n\\left(h + \\frac{1}{8}\\right)^2 + \\left(w + \\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2 - (h^2 + w^2) \\geq r_0^2 - (r_0 - 1)^2,\n\\]\n\nie. if\n\n\\[\n\\frac{h}{4} + \\frac{w}{2} + \\frac{5}{64} \\geq 2r_0 - 1, \\quad (1)\n\\]\n\nas then the interval of possible values for $r$ can cover more than one integer.\n\nHowever, if $r_0 = 1$, the right-hand side is 1 and the left-hand side is at most $\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{5}{64} < 1$.\n\nIf we increase $r_0$ by $k$, then the right-hand side is increased by $2k$, but the left-hand side by at most $3k/4$. Thus the inequality (1) never holds, and so we can always determine the radius from this data.",

          "latex": "In this solution, all references to digits should be understood to mean in base 2. We write $l(n)$ to denote the number of digits in $n$. Since $2500 \\le 4096 = 2^{12}$, we have $l(n) \\le 12$ for all $n \\le 2500$.\n\nWe divide into cases according to the number $l(n)$. If $l(n) = 12$, then the first digit of is 1 and (since $2500 < 2^{11} + 2^9$) the next two must be 0.\n\nBy a \"substring\" of $n$, we shall mean a number that appears as a consecutive block in the base 2 representation of $n$. Clearly we can assume that a substring must start with a 1.\n\nThere is only one substring of length 12, one of length 11, and one of length 10 in $n$, since $l(n) = 12$, because such substrings can't begin at the second or third digit. Similarly, there are two or fewer distinct substrings of length 9, at three or fewer of length 8, and so on, and seven or fewer of length 4.\n\nAlso, there are only $2^{k-1}$ different numbers of length $k$ (since we must start with 1 and have $k-1$ choices of 0 or 1 thereafter). So there are one or fewer distinct substrings of length 1, two or fewer distinct substrings of length 2, and four or fewer of length 3.\n\nTherefore, in the case that $l(n) = 12$, we have (counting substrings of each possible length):\n\n$$\nb(n) \\le 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 4 + 2 + 1 = 37 \\le 39.\n$$\n\nIf $l(n) \\le 10$, there are one or fewer substrings of length 10, two or fewer of length 9, and so on. As before there are one or fewer distinct substrings of length 1, two or fewer distinct substrings of length 2, and four or fewer of length 3.\n\nSo, in this case,\n\n$$\nb(n) \\le 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 35 \\le 39.\n$$\n\nFinally we consider the case where $l(n) = 11$. Using the estimates of before, we get\n\n$$\nb(n) \\le 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 43.\n$$\n\nHowever, if we have a zero as the d-th digit from the right, that reduces the maximum number of substrings of length e (for all $4 \\le e \\le d$) by one. Hence any zero in the leftmost four digits reduces the maximum number of substrings by at least 5 (and so $b(n) \\le 43 - 5 = 38$). Also, if there are three zeros among the leftmost eight digits of n, they reduce the bound by at least six (and so $b(n) \\le 43 - 6 = 37$). Further, any two zeros in the leftmost seven digits reduce it by five (and so $b(n) \\le 43 - 5 = 38$). In each case, we need look no further.\n\nSo, if $b(n) \\ge 39$, the number $n$ must look like $1111a_1a_2a_3b_1b_2b_3b_4$, where at most one of the $a_i$s is zero. If all the $a_i$s are ones, then there are four identical substrings 1111 of length four, and three identical substrings 11111 of length five. This means there are at least five duplicates, so $b(n) < 39$.\n\nIf $a_1 = a_2 = 1$ and $a_3 = 0$, then having $a_3 = 0$ reduces the bound by two, and $a_1 = a_2 = 1$ causes two duplicates of 1111 and one duplicate of 11111 at the beginning. This reduces the bound by $2+2+1=5$, and so $b(n) < 39$. If $a_1 = a_3 = 1$ and $a_2 = 0$, then having $a_2 = 0$ reduces the bound by three and causes a duplicate of 1111 at the beginning, meaning $b(n) \\le 39$. If $a_2 = a_3 = 1$ and $a_1 = 0$, then having $a_1 = 0$ reduces the bound by four, meaning $b(n) \\le 39$.\n\nIn any case we have now proved $b(n) \\le 39$; we will now investigate the cases of equality. These are the cases where $a_1$ or $a_2$ is zero. We must also have $b_1 = 1$ (else it will reduce the bound by 1). So the number looks like $1111a_1a_211b_2b_3b_4$. However, if $a_1 = 0$ and $a_2 = 1$, we either have a duplicate of 1111 or of 1110. Thus $a_1 = 1$ and $a_2 = 0$, and the number looks like $11111011b_2b_3b_4$. However, if $b_1 = 1$, we will again certainly get a duplicate of length 4.\n\nSo the number looks like $111110110b_3b_4$. If $b_2 = 1$, then 1101 is duplicated. So the only possibilities are\n\n$$\n11111011000, \\text{ and} \\tag{1}\n$$\n\n$$\n11111011001. \\tag{2}\n$$\n\nWe can tabulate the distinct substrings of each by length:\n\n% IMAGE: <table><thead><tr><th>length</th><th>(1)</th><th>(2)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>6</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody><tfoot><tr><td>total</td><td>39</td><td>39.</td></tr></tfoot></table>\n\nHence these two (and only these two) give equality.

It is easy to check that the number in row $i$, column $j$ of the table above is $\\binom{i+j}{j}$.\n\nSo we guess that our number will be $\\binom{16}{6}$: to prove this we need to express any score as a choice of six objects from a set of sixteen.

But this is the same as the number of ways of choosing six steps to be \"rightwards\" out of the set of sixteen. This is, by definition, the binomial coefficient $\\binom{16}{6}$.\n\nWe can compute this binomial coefficient by the standard method:\n\n$$\n\\binom{16}{6} = \\frac{16!}{6!10!} = \\frac{16 \\times 15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11}{6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 8008.\n$$",

Choosing useful special cases is an art form, but the following solution contains some methods which are frequently useful.\n\nWe start by making some substitutions which seem likely to give helpful bits of information. Setting $y = 0$ gives\n\n$$\nf(x)f(0) = f(x)\n$$\n\nwhence $f(x)f(0) - 1) = 0$, so either $f(x) = 0$ for all $x$, or $f(0) = 1$. The former is untenable (for example, from substituting $x = y = 1$), so we can conclude that $f(0) = 1$.\n\nWe can make use this by substituting $y = -x$: we get\n\n$$\nf(x)f(-x) = f(0) - x^2 = 1 - x^2.\n$$\n\nand so in particular\n\n$$\nf(1)f(-1) = 1 - 1^2 = 0.\n$$\n\nThus we have $f(1) = 0$ or $f(-1) = 0$.\n\nIf $f(1) = 0$, then we can make use of this by substituting $y = 1$ to get\n\n$$\n0 = f(x)f(1) = f(x + 1) + x.\n$$\n\nso $f(x + 1) = -x$ or equivalently $f(x) = 1 - x$. It is easy to check that this is indeed a valid solution.\n\nOn the other hand, if $f(-1) = 0$, then we can substitute $y = -1$ and get\n\n$$\n0 = f(x)f(-1) = f(x - 1) - x.\n$$\n\nso $f(x - 1) = x$ or equivalently $f(x) = 1 + x$.

For example, $2011 = 1111011011_2$ (subscript 2 denotes binary) and so $f(2011) = 10101_2 = 21$.\n\nLet $g$ be the function described above, and let $f$ be the function defined\nin the question. We will prove by induction that $f(n) = g(n)$ for all $n$.\n\n**Base case.** We have $f(1) = g(1) = 1$, $f(2) = g(2) = 2$ and $f(3) = g(3) = 1$.\n\n**Induction.** Suppose $f(k) = g(k)$ for all $k < n$. If $n = 2k$ is even, then there are two cases.\n\n* If $k$ is even then $2n$ ends ... 00 in binary; $g$ treats the double '0' exactly the same as a single '0' and so $g(2n) = g(k)$. By definition $f(2n) = f(k)$, and so from the assumption that $f(k) = g(k)$ we get $f(2n) = g(2n)$.\n\n* If $k$ is odd then $2n$ ends ... 10. So $g(2n)$ will be $g(k)$ with a '0' added at the end — that is, $g(2n) = 2g(k)$. By definition $f(2n) = 2f(k)$, and so as before $f(2n) = g(2n)$.\n\nIf $n = 2k + 1$ is odd there are again two cases.\n\n* If $k$ is odd then $2k + 1$ ends ... 11 in binary; $g$ treats the double '1' exactly the same as a single '1' and so $g(2k+1) = g(k)$. By definition $f(2k+1) = f(k)$, and so as before $f(2k+1) = g(2k+1)$.\n\n* If $k$ is even then $2k + 1$ ends ... 01. So $g(2k + 1)$ will be $g(k)$ with a '1' added at the end — that is, $g(2k + 1) = 2g(k) + 1$. By definition $f(2k + 1) = 2f(k) + 1$ and so as before $f(2k + 1) = g(2k + 1)$.\n\nNow $f(2011) = 10101_2 = 21$ and so $f(n) = f(2011)$ if and only if $n$ has 5 changes of digit in its binary expansion. We consider a number to have infinitely many leading zeros, so that there is always one change at the start of the number. For example, $111100001_2$ has 3 changes. The number of $n$ with at most 11 binary digits (i.e. $n < 2048$) and with exactly 5 changes is $\\binom{11}{5} = 462$, since the 5 changes can be placed in any of 11 places.\n\nBy exhaustive search we see that 7 of these possibilities are not less than 2011. These are $1111011011_2, 1111011101_2, 1111100101_2, 1111101001_2, 1111101011_2, 1111101101_2$ and $1111110101_2$.\n\nThus the total number of $n < 2011$ with $f(n) = f(2011)$ is $462 - 7 = 455$.",

When $n=1$, this is clearly true, and if we suppose that $\\sum_{r=1}^{k} = k^2$ then\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{r=1}^{k+1} (2r-1) = \\sum_{r=1}^{k} (2r-1) + 2k+1 = (k+1)^2\n\\]\n\nand so our claim is true for all $n$.\n\nSo for positive integers $x$ and $y$,\n\n\\[\nx^2 - y^2 = \\sum_{r=y+1}^{x} (2r-1)\n\\]\n\nSo whenever we have a solution to the original equation, we have a set of consecutive positive odd integers that sum to 89. The sum of an even number of odd integers is even, and as 89 is odd this means that there must be an odd number of integers in the sum. But then there is a 'middle' integer in the list, which divides the sum. But as 89 is prime, the only way we can make 89 as a sum of consecutive odd integers is 89 itself.\n\nSo we must have $a = 44$ and hence $(n + 10)^2 = 45^2$. This gives us two possibilities (corresponding to positive and negative square roots) for $n$: 35 and -55. We can check that these do both give us $n^2 + 20n + 11 = 44^2$.",

Prove that $DE + EF \\le BC$ and determine the triangles for which equality holds.\n\nThe altitude through A is the line through A which is perpendicular to BC. The foot of this altitude is the point D where it meets BC. The other altitudes are similarly defined.\n\nMost people who solved this problem used trigonometry to reduce the problem to an algebraic inequality, which could then be solved with a variety of methods - solution 1 is a nice example of this approach. It is also possible to give a more 'geometric' proof of the inequality, as in solution 3. Solution 2 is an interesting hybrid of the two approaches.\n\nAn angle-chase common to all three solutions is this: because $\\angle AEB$ and $\\angle ADB$ are right angled, $AEDB$ is cyclic with diameter AB. So $\\angle EDC = 180^\\circ - \\angle BDE = \\angle BAE = \\angle BAC$ by the fact that opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral add to 180$^\\circ$. Similarly, $\\angle FDC = \\angle CAB$.\n\nIn all solutions, let A, B and C be the angles of triangle ABC and let a, b and c be the lengths of BC, CA and AB respectively.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/V_Britanija_2012_p10_data_e466e3d4a4.png)"

We can reach an arbitrary point P inside ABC by starting at the centre $P_0$ and moving along the line PD and then along the line PE (for some distance in either direction). We will prove that the equality a) holds by proving that it is preserved by such movements of P.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/V_Britanija_2014_p21_data_8b30615088.png)\n\nConsider points P and P' such that P' lies on the segment PE, as shown in the above diagram. Let the feet of the perpendiculars from P' to BC and AB be D' and F' respectively. Also let T be the foot of the perpendicular from P to P'F'.\n\nBy considering quadrilateral P'EAF', $\\angle TPP' = \\angle EAF' = 60^\\circ$. So $PT = PP' \\sin 60^\\circ$. But $PTF'F$ is a rectangle and so $FF' = PP' \\sin 60^\\circ$.

Similarly it is preserved when moving along the line *PD*. Since it holds when *P* is the centroid of *ABC*, it holds for all points *P* inside *ABC*.\n\nTo prove part b), we'll use the same method; the result is clearly true when *P* is the centroid of the triangle, and we will show that the equality is preserved by movements along the lines *PD* and *PE*.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/V_Britanija_2014_p22_data_2c19ba22d1.png)\n\nFor ease of notation, we'll call the lengths $PD = r_1$, $P'D' = r'_1$, $PE = r_2$ and so on as indicated in the diagram. Also, let $PP' = d$. First of all note that, as $\\angle PP'T = 60^\\circ$, $P'T = P'U = \\frac{d}{2}$ and so $r_1 - r'_1 = \\frac{d}{2} = r_3 - r'_3$.

From our earlier work, $r_1 - r_3 = r'_1 - r'_3$. This holds for all $P'$ along the line *PE*, and so we could pick $P'' = E$.\n\nThus, when $r_1''$ is the perpendicular distance from $E$ to $BC$ and $r_3''$ is the perpendicular distance from $E$ to $AB$, we have that $(r_1 - r_3) = (r_1'' - r_3'')$.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/V_Britanija_2014_p23_data_ad9ba44994.png)\n\nNow since $\\angle D'CE = 60^\\circ$, we know that $r_1'' = CE \\sin 60^\\circ$ and similarly $r_3'' = EA \\sin 60^\\circ$.

Hence, there is a prime $p$ which divides $a_{n-1} - 1$, and so divides $a_n$ but not $a_{n-1}$, and thus not $a_m$ for any $m < n$.

Let $C_B$ and $C_G$ denote the number of boys and girls respectively in a particular class.\n\nWe start by proving that for any school where all classes have more girls than boys there are always more councils with an even number of boys, regardless of whether the number of classes is odd or even. We prove this by induction.\n\nSuppose a school has $n$ classes, each with more girls than boys. If $n = 0$, then there is one council, which is empty and thus has an even number of boys.\n\nFor the inductive step, suppose we know that for the first $n$ classes, $k_E > k_O$, and we add a class with $C_G > C_B$. If the new values of the numbers of even and odd councils are $k'_E$ and $k'_O$ respectively, then we have\n\n$$\nk'_E = C_B k_O + C_G k_E\n$$\n\n$$\nk'_O = C_G k_O + C_B k_E\n$$\n\nand so, by the rearrangement inequality, $k'_E > k'_O$.\n\nIf, on the other hand, we add a class with more boys than girls, and $k_E > k_O$, the rearrangement inequality tells us that $k'_E < k'_O$. Similarly if we add a class with more girls than boys, and $k_E < k_O$, the same argument shows that $k'_E > k'_O$.\n\nIf we construct a school by adding classes one at a time, and there are an odd number of classes with more boys than girls, then we will observe $k_E$ and $k_O$ flipping which is larger an odd number of times, and so at the end $k_E < k_O$. Conversely, if there are an even number of classes with more boys than girls, then the order of $k_E$ and $k_O$ will flip an even number of times and so at the end $k_E > k_O$.

A locus is the collection of all points which satisfy a given condition.\n\nLet $I$ denote the incentre of triangle $AQP$. In order to determine the locus of $I$, it seems to be essential to observe that the line $AI$ passes through the contact point (say $L$) of the chord $PQ$ with the inner circle.

Since $n$ starts even and alternates between even and odd, we have either $e = o$ or $e = o+1$.\n\nWe consider the number of odd states for each $r$ and sum over $r$ from 1 to 100. In the summation below we only list explicitly the number of states for $r = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \\dots, 49, 50, 51, 52, \\dots, 97, 98, 99, 100$. We obtain\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + \\dots + 25 + 25 + 25 + 24 + \\dots + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 \\\\\n&= 2(1 + 2 + \\dots + 25) + 2(1 + 2 + \\dots + 24) + 25 \\\\\n&= 25 \\times 26 + 24 \\times 25 + 25 \\\\\n&= 25 \\times 51 \\\\\n&= 1275.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nThe total number of even states satisfies $e \\le o + 1 \\le 1276$. Thus the total possible number of states is at most $1275 + 1276 = 2551$. This is one more than the total number of moves, since the first state doesn't require a move to get to, but the other states do. So the maximum number of moves is 2550.\n\nOne strategy using this number of moves is as follows.\n\n(i) If $r$ is even and $b = 0$ place one pebble in the red bag if we can;\n\n(ii) otherwise, if $r$ is even but $b > 0$ remove one pebble from the blue bag;",

We know, for every $k$, that $a_k a_{k+1} a_{k+2} = n$ (where we take the indices modulo $n$ so that, for example, $a_{n+1} = a_1$).

The condition on the surface areas is then\n\n$$\n2\\pi(ap)^2 + 2\\pi(p^2+pb)^2 + 2\\pi(p^2+pb) = 2\\pi(a^2 + b^2)(p^2 + p) = 8\\pi, \\\\ \\text{i.e. } (a^2 + b^2)(p^2 + p) = 4.\n$$\n\nThe condition on the volumes is\n\n$$\n\\pi(ap)^2a + 2\\pi(p^2+pb)^2b = \\pi(a^3 + b^3)p^2 = 2\\pi, \\\\ \\text{i.e. } (a^3 + b^3)p^2 = 2.\n$$\n\nAs the sum of the heights is 1, $a+b=1$. Let $k = ab$. Then $a^2 + b^2 = (a+b)^2 - 2ab = 1 - 2k$, and $a^3 + b^3 = (a+b)^3 - 3ab(a+b) = 1 - 3k$. We substitute these into the previous equations to get\n\n$$\n(1 - 2k)(p^2 + p) = 4, \\\\ (1 - 3k)p^2 = 2.\n$$\n\nSubtracting the second from the first gives\n\n$$\np - 2kp + kp^2 = 2, \\\\ \\text{i.e. } p - 2 = kp(2 - p).\n$$\n\nIf $p \\neq 2$, we get $kp = -1$, but both k and p are positive, so $p = 2$. As $(1 - 3k)p^2 = 2$, we get $ab = k = \\frac{1}{6}$. Substitute $b = \\frac{1}{6a}$ into $a + b = 1$, and multiply both sides by a to get $a^2 - a + \\frac{1}{6} = 0$.

There are $\\binom{2018}{1009-i}$ ways for Ada to allocate when she moves north in her schedule. Then there are $\\binom{1009+i}{1009-i}$ ways for her to allocate the south moves (once the north moves have been selected). Finally there are $\\binom{2i}{i}$ ways for her to allocate the east moves (once the north and south moves have been selected). The west moves are then determined. Note that she cannot move east more than 1009 times so the total number of possible journeys is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nn &= \\sum_{i=0}^{1009} \\binom{2018}{1009-i} \\binom{1009+i}{1009-i} \\binom{2i}{i} \\\\\n&= \\sum_{i=0}^{1009} \\frac{2018!}{(1009-i)!(1009+i)!} \\cdot \\frac{(1009+i)!}{(1009-i)!(2i)!} \\cdot \\frac{(2i)!}{i!i!} \\\\\n&= \\sum_{i=0}^{1009} \\frac{2018!}{[(1009-i)!i!]^2} = \\sum_{i=0}^{1009} \\frac{2018!}{1009!1009!} \\left[ \\frac{1009!}{(1009-i)!i!} \\right]^2 \\\\\n&= \\binom{2018}{1009} \\sum_{i=0}^{1009} \\binom{1009}{i}^2.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow the number of ways of choosing $i$ things from 1009 is the same as the number of ways choosing 1009 - $i$ things from 1009 so $\\binom{1009}{i} = \\binom{1009}{1009-i}$.

Therefore $n = \\binom{2008}{1009}^2$.\n\nTo find the highest power of 10 which divides $n = \\binom{2018}{1009}^2 = \\binom{2018!}{1009!}^2$ we will calculate the highest powers of 2 and 5 which divide 2018! and 1009!.

Similar calculations show that the highest power of 2 dividing 2018! is 2011, the highest power of 5 dividing 1009! is 250 and the highest power of 2 dividing 1009! is 1002.\n\nNow $2 \\times 502 - 4 \\times 250 = 4$ so the highest power of 5 dividing $n = \\binom{2018!}{1009!}^2$ is $5^4$, while $2 \\times 2011 - 4 \\times 1002 = 14$ so the highest power of 2 dividing $n$ is $2^{14}$. Therefore the highest power of 10 dividing $n$ is $10^4 = 10,000$.",

We initially arrange the pieces on the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, i.e. on the diagonals of the megasquares which themselves are on the diagonal of the main grid. Numbering the megasquares on the main diagonal $1$ to $n$, we move the pieces in the odd-numbered megasquares down by $n$, and in the even numbered ones up by $n$. As there are $n$ rows of megasquares, the last one moves up so they all stay on the board. We have in effect moved the megasquares, and there is still one in each row and column, so the final configuration meets the conditions.

Hence it is enough to show that there are $\\frac{2^p-2}{p} + 2$ subsets of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, p\\}$ with sum divisible by $p$. We will in fact show that there are $\\frac{2^p-2}{p}$ subsets of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, p\\}$ of size between 1 and $p-1$ and sum divisible by $p$: this is enough as the empty set and $\\{1, 2, \\dots, p\\}$ both have sum divisible by $p$.\n\nCall two subsets $A$ and $B$ of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, p\\}$ siblings if we can write $A = \\{a_1, \\dots, a_i\\}$ and $B = \\{b_1, \\dots, b_i\\}$ with $b_j \\equiv a_j + m \\pmod p$ for each $1 \\le j \\le i$ where $m \\ne 0 \\pmod p$. Note that any set $A$ has $p-1$ siblings (as $m$ can take any non-zero value modulo $p$). Furthermore, provided $i$ is not 0 or $p$, these siblings are all different to $A$ as $s(B) \\equiv s(A) + im \\ne s(A) \\pmod p$.\n\nIf sets $A$, $B$ and $C$ are distinct with $B$ and $C$ being siblings of $A$ then $B$ and $C$ are siblings of each other. In particular if $A$ and $B$ are siblings, then $B$ is also siblings with the other $p-2$ siblings of $A$. As each set has at most $p-1$ siblings these must be all the siblings of $B$.\n\nLet $I(A)$ be $A$ together with its siblings. We have shown that if $A$ and $B$ are siblings then $I(A) = I(B)$. On the other hand if $I(A)$ and $I(B)$ have $C$ in common then $A$ and $B$ must themselves be siblings. Hence if $A$ and $B$ are not siblings then $I(A)$ and $I(B)$ are disjoint.\n\nThe $p$ sets in $I(A)$ have distinct sums modulo $p$ so exactly one of them has sum divisible by $p$. Furthermore each set of size between 1 and $p-1$ appears in exactly one $I(A)$. Now the number of subsets of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, p\\}$ is $2^p$ so the number of subsets with size between 1 and $p-1$ is $2^p - 2$. Therefore the number of subsets of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, p\\}$ with size between 1 and $p-1$ and sum divisible by $p$ is $\\frac{2^p-2}{p}$.",

The mean of the sequence $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n, n+2+B_n$ is an integer, as it is the sum of the two sequences $1, 2, \\dots, n, n+1$ and $b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n, B_n+1$ of consecutive integers, and the mean of any sequence of $n+1$ consecutive integers is an integer (respectively a half-integer) according as $n$ is even (respectively odd). It follows that $a_{n+1}$ is congruent to $n+2+B_n \\pmod{n+1}$. Since $n+2+B_n$ is greater than any of $a_1, \\dots, a_n$ (as $a_i = i+b_i$ with $i < n+1$ and $b_i < B_n+1$, we know that $a_{n+1} \\le n+2+B_n$, and hence $a_{n+1}$ is equal to $n+2+B_n$ or $1+B_n$ (as $B_n-n < 0$). Thus $b_{n+1}$ is equal to $B_n+1$ or $B_n-n$, and the integers $b_1, \\dots, b_{n+1}$ are consecutive. This completes the induction. It follows that every integer appears in the sequence $b_1, b_2, \\dots$ at most once.\n\nTo complete the problem, we need only check that $b_n > 0$ infinitely often and also that $b_n < 0$ infinitely often. For the former, we simply note that if $b_n < 0$, then we cannot also have $b_{n+1} < 0$. Indeed, since $0 = b_1$ is among the consecutive integers $b_1, \\dots, b_n$, the only way we could have $b_{n+1} < 0$ would be if $b_{n+1} = b_n - 1$, in which case $a_{n+1} = a_n$, which is not possible. For the latter, suppose for contradiction that there is some $n_0$ such that $b_n > 0$ for all $n > n_0$. It follows that for $n > n_0$ we have $b_n = n - \\delta$, and hence $a_n = 2n - \\delta$, for some $\\delta$. Since the mean of $a_1, \\dots, a_{n-1}$, $n - \\delta$ is also an integer, it follows that $n - \\delta$ must appear in the sequence $a_1, \\dots, a_{n-1}$ for all $n > n_0$. If in addition $n$ is odd, we cannot have $n - \\delta = a_{n'} = 2n' - \\delta$ for an integer $n' > n_0$, and hence $n - \\delta$ must even appear in the sequence $a_1, \\dots, a_{n_0}$.

So a pile is regular if and only if its label is $(0, 0, \\dots, 0)$.\n\nIt is enough to construct one regular pile, since the remaining boxes form another regular pile.\n\nSuppose we have enough cards to ensure that there are $P$ non-empty boxes, where $P$ is some large number to be chosen later. We may view each of these boxes as pile. This is our first collection of piles.\n\nTheir labels all have the property that for all $i$, $|d_i| \\le 2022$.\n\nWe also have $\\sum d_2 = 0$ where the sum is taken over all the piles.\n\nNow suppose that the maximum value of $|d_2| = M$. We aim to form a new collection of piles such that each new pile is either one of the old piles, or is formed by combining exactly two old piles. If we have some old piles with $d_2 = M$ and others with $d_2 = -M$ we pair these up to form new piles with $d_2 = 0$. Once we have done this as many times as possible, the remaining piles with $|d_2| = M$ all have $d_2$ with the same sign. Consider such a pile: if it has $d_2 = M$ we combine it with any old pile with a negative value of $d_2$. There are sure to be enough of these, since the $d_2$ values sum to zero. The case where the signs are reversed is identical.\n\nAfter this process we have at least $P/2$ piles. For these piles the maximum value of $|d_2|$ has decreased (by at least one) and the maximum value of $|d_i|$ for each other $i$ has at most doubled.\n\nThus if we repeat this process (up to) 2022 times we will reach a situation where we have at least $P/(2^{2022})$ piles and each pile will have $d_2 = 0$ and $|d_i| \\le 2022 \\times 2^{2022}$ for all other $i$.\n\nNow we may run this argument again working with $d_3$ instead of $d_2$, then again with $d_4$ and so on. More formally, we proceed by induction.\n\nSuppose that for some $k$ we have a collection of $P_k$ piles such that:\n\n* For each pile $d_2 = d_3 = \\dots = d_k = 0$ and\n* For all piles and all $i > k$ we have $|d_i| \\le M_k$ for some fixed $M_k$\n\nThen, by combining the piles as described above, we can reach a situation where we have at least $P_k/(2^{M_k})$ piles, each of which has $d_{k+1} = 0$ and $|d_i| \\le 2^{M_k}$ for all $i$.\n\nSetting $P_{k+1} = P_k/(2^{M_k})$ and $M_{k+1} = 2^{M_k}$ we have the same situation as before but with $k+1$ in place of $k$.\n\nThus, if we take $P$ large enough, we can ensure that $P_{50} \\ge 2$ which is enough to solve the problem.",
