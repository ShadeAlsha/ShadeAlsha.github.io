As $\\text{lcm}(24, 9) = 24 \\cdot 3$, he covers every 3rd suspicious week. Also assume that 5 and 10 do not have common working weeks. As $\\text{lcm}(24, 5) = \\text{lcm}(24, 10) = 24 \\cdot 5$, each of them covers every 5th suspicious week. Also, 7 and 11 cover every 7th and every 11th suspicious week, respectively. Hence we are facing a subproblem that considers only the suspicious weeks and the schedule is made for one 3, two 5s, one 7 and one 11.\n\nThe relative position of the working weeks of one 3 and one 5 is not important (by Chinese remainder theorem). By symmetry, there are only two in principle different ways to insert the second 5: he is shifted with respect to the other 5 either by one or by two suspicious weeks. Correspondingly, we get the following schedules (where $\\bullet$ denotes suspicious weeks during which either 3 or one of the 5s is working and $\\circ$ denotes the remaining suspicious weeks):\n\n$$\n(1) \\bullet\\bullet\\bullet\\circ\\circ\\bullet\\circ\\circ\\bullet\\circ\\circ\\bullet\\circ\\circ\\bullet\\circ\\circ\\bullet\\circ\\circ\\bullet\\circ\\circ\\bullet\\circ\\circ\\bullet\\circ\\circ\\dots\n$$\n\n$$\n(2) \\bullet\\circ\\circ\\circ\\circ\\circ\\bullet\\circ\\circ\\circ\\bullet\\circ\\circ\\circ\\bullet\\circ\\circ\\circ\\bullet\\circ\\circ\\circ\\dots\n$$\n\nAs 7 and 15 are coprime, each of the schedules (1) and (2) gives rise to only one schedule with 7 (by Chinese remainder theorem again).

Let the dissections of convex $n$-gons together with appropriate colourings be called \\emph{n-colourings}.\n\nObserve that all triangles of an arbitrary $n$-colouring can be listed, starting with an arbitrary triangle and always continuing the list by a triangle that is a neighbour to some triangle already in the list. Indeed, suppose that some triangle $\\Delta$ is missing from the list. Choose a point $A$ inside a triangle in the list, as well as a point $D$ inside $\\Delta$. By convexity, the line segment $AD$ is entirely inside the polygon. As the vertices of the triangles are vertices of the polygon, $AD$ crosses the sides of the triangles only outside their vertices. Hence any consecutive triangles that $AD$ passes through are neighbours. The first triangle that ray $AD$ visits and that is not in the list is one that the list can be continued with.\n\nConsider such a list of all triangles that starts with a white triangle. Each triangle has at most three neighbours and each black triangle has at least one neighbour occurring in the list before it. Thus at most two neighbours of any black triangle are following it in the list. Each white triangle except for the first one is a neighbour of some triangle preceding it in the list, and according to the construction, that triangle is black. Hence among all triangles except for the first one, there are at most twice as many white triangles as there are black triangles. Altogether, this means $w \\le 2b+1$ where $b$ and $w$ are the numbers of black and white triangles in the construction, respectively. Observe that this formula holds also if there are no white triangles.\n\nHence there are at most $3b + 1$ triangles altogether, i.e., $n - 2 \\le 3b + 1$. In integers, this implies $b \\ge \\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\rfloor - 1$ which is equivalent to $b \\ge \\lfloor \\frac{n-1}{3} \\rfloor$.\n\nThis number of black triangles can be achieved as follows. Number all vertices of the polygon by 0 through $n-1$.\n\nIf $n = 3k, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$, then draw diagonals $(0, 3i - 1)$, $(3i - 1, 3i + 1)$, $(3i + 1, 0)$ for all $i = 1, \\dots, k - 1$.

Since the three intersection points cannot be simply collinear, they must in fact coincide in the sought point $P$.\n\nAnother way to establish the existence and uniqueness of $P$ is to calculate\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\angle BPC &= 180^\\circ - B_2 - C_1 = 180^\\circ - B \\\\\n\\angle CPA &= 180^\\circ - C_2 - A_1 = 180^\\circ - C \\\\\n\\angle APB &= 180^\\circ - A_2 - B_1 = 180^\\circ - A,\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand observe that the locus of points $X$ such that $\\angle BXC$ has a fixed value is the arc of a circle. The three equations above give three arcs, and the unique intersection point of any two of them must also lie on the third one.\n\nCase 2: $ABC \\sim A'C'B'$. We get the following system of equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nA_1 + A_2 &= B_1 + C_2 \\\\\nC_1 + C_2 &= C_1 + A_2 \\\\\nB_1 + B_2 &= A_1 + B_2,\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith the solution $A_2 = C_2$ and $A_1 = B_1$. As above, this criterion specifies a unique point $P$.\n\nCase 3: $ABC \\sim A'B'C'$. We get the following system of equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nA_1 + A_2 &= B_1 + C_2 \\\\\nB_1 + B_2 &= C_1 + A_2 \\\\\nC_1 + C_2 &= A_1 + B_2,\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich leads to\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\angle BPC &= 180^\\circ - B_2 - C_1 = 2A \\\\\n\\angle CPA &= 180^\\circ - C_2 - A_1 = 2B \\\\\n\\angle APB &= 180^\\circ - A_2 - B_1 = 2C.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis shows that the point $P$ in this case is the circumcentre.\n\nConsequently, each permutation of the three vertices produces similarity for a unique point $P$, leading to a total of six points (which may not always be distinct).",

Thus, $f(x_0) = x_0$. Similarly, taking $x = -x_0$, $y = f(-x_0) + x_0$ in (1) one can prove that $f(-x_0) = -x_0$. However, this implies $f(x_0) - f(-x_0) = x_0 - (-x_0) = 2x_0$ again, and we obtain a contradiction.\n\nNow we take $x = -y$ in (1):\n\n$$\nyf(2y) = y^2 + f^2(y). \\quad (3)\n$$\n\nSimilarly,\n\n$$\n-yf(-2y) = y^2 + f^2(-y). \\quad (4)\n$$\n\nWe add (3) and (4) and use (2) twice:\n\n$$\n4y^2 = y(f(2y)-f(-2y)) = 2y^2+f^2(y)+f^2(-y) = 2y^2+f^2(y)+(f(y)-2y)^2 \\implies (f(y)-y)^2 = 0\n$$\n\nHence, we have proved that $f(y) = y$ for all $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This function satisfies the condition of the problem.\n\nAnswer. $f(x) \\equiv 0$ and $f(x) \\equiv x$.",

We claim that $f(n) = f(n-1) + f(1)$ for all integers $n > 1$. Indeed, for any integer $m > n$, we have $m \\mid f(n) + f(m-n)$ and $m \\mid f(n-1) + f(1) + f(m-n)$ by conditions of the problem. Hence the difference $f(n) - (f(n-1) + f(1))$ is also divisible by $m$. As $m$ was arbitrary, this implies that $f(n) - (f(n-1) + f(1))$ is divisible by an infinite number of different integers, i.e., is equal to 0. This completes the proof of the claim.\n\nEasy induction now gives that necessarily $f(n) = nf(1)$. It remains to verify that all functions of the form $f(n) = an$ satisfy the conditions of the problem, which is straightforward.",

Next we consider the special case $p = q$. Then $p^2(p+1)$ is a perfect square, for which reason there exists an integer $n$ satisfying $p = n^2 - 1 = (n+1)(n-1)$. Since $p$ is prime, this factorization yields $n = 2$ and thus $p = 3$. This completes the discussion of the case $p = q$.\n\n3.) So from now on we may suppose that $p$ and $q$ are distinct odd prime. Let $a$ be a positive integer such that $p^2 + q^3 = a^2$, i.e. $q^3 = (a+p)(a-p)$. If both factors $a+p$ and $a-p$ were divisible by $q$, then so were their difference $2p$, which is absurd. So by uniqueness of prime factorization we have $a+p = q^3$ and $a-p = 1$. Subtracting these equations we learn $q^3 = 2p+1$. Due to symmetry we also have $p^3 = 2q+1$. Now if $p < q$, then $q^3 = 2p+1 < 2q+1 = p^3$, which gives a contradiction, and the case $q < p$ is excluded similarly.\n\nThereby the problem is solved.",

Let $k$ be the largest of the numbers $x_1, \\dots, x_{2011}$, and consider an equation $x_{n-1} + x_n = 2k$, where $1 \\le n \\le 2011$. Hence we get $2 \\max(x_{n-1}, x_n) \\ge x_{n-1} + x_n = 2k$, so either $x_{n-1}$ or $x_n$ is $\\ge k$. Since $x_{n-1} \\le k$, we then have $x_{n-1} = k$, and then also $x_n = 2k - x_{n-1} = 2k - k = k$. That is, in such an equation both variables on the left equal $k$. Now let $\\mathcal{E}$ be the set of such equations, and let $\\mathcal{S}$ be the set of subscripts on the left of these equations. From $x_n = k \\forall n \\in \\mathcal{S}$ we get $|\\mathcal{S}| \\le |\\mathcal{E}|$. On the other hand, since the total number of appearances of these subscripts is $2|\\mathcal{E}|$ and each subscript appears on the left in no more than two equations, we have $2|\\mathcal{E}| \\le 2|\\mathcal{S}|$. Thus $2|\\mathcal{E}| = 2|\\mathcal{S}|$, so for each $n \\in \\mathcal{S}$ the set $\\mathcal{E}$ contains both equations with the subscript $n$ on the left.

Let us first assume $a > 0$. Taking $x = -f(y)$ in the given equation we get\n\\[\nf(-f(y)) = f(0) - f(y)^3 = (-f(y))^3 + c, \\quad c = f(0). \\quad (1)\n\\]\nThe function\n\\[\ng(x) = f(x + a) - f(x) = (x + a)^3 - x^3 = 3a\\left(x + \\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 + \\frac{a^3}{4}\n\\]\ntakes every value $z \\ge a^3/4$. For every such $z = g(x)$, equation (1) then gives\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned} f(z) &= f(g(x)) = f(-f(x) + f(x + a)) \\\\ &= f(-f(x)) + (-f(x) + f(x + a))^3 - (-f(x))^3 \\end{aligned} \\quad (2) \\\\ &= g(x)^3 + c = z^3 + c.\n\\]\nThus $f$ takes every value not less than $(a^3/4)^3 + c$, which implies that $f$ is unlimited from above. For every $x$ we can then choose a $y$ such that $x + f(y) \\ge a^3/4$ so that from (2) we get\n\\[\nf(x) = f(x + f(y)) - (x + f(y))^3 + x^3 = x^3 + c.\n\\]\nThis function evidently satisfies the given equation for an arbitrary $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nIf $a < 0$, we can set $f(x) = -h(-x)$. It is easily verified that if $f$ satisfies the given equation, so does $h$. Furthermore $h$ takes the value $-a > 0$, so $h$ is given by $h(x) = x^3 + c$ for some $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Hence we get $f(x) = x^3 - c$. Since these functions form the same class as those which were found above, this completes the proof.",

          "latex": "Call stable tuples, whose elements are alternately negative and non-negative, interesting. We first show that each interesting tuple contains at least one stable subtuple of 3 elements.\n\nFor that, consider elements whose absolute value is minimal in the tuple. If there exists a negative such element, denote it $a_i$, then the sum of $a_i$ and its any neighbour is non-negative. Thus $a_i$ is neither the first nor the last in the tuple because of stability of the tuple. But then both $a_{i-1} + a_i$ and $a_i + a_{i+1}$ are non-negative, as well as $a_{i-1} + a_i + a_{i+1}$, hence ($a_{i-1}$, $a_i$, $a_{i+1}$) is a stable subtuple. On the other hand, if all elements with minimal absolute value are non-negative then let $a_i$ be any of them. Analogously to the previous case, both $a_{i-1} + a_i$ and $a_i + a_{i+1}$ are negative, as well as $a_{i-1} + a_i + a_{i+1}$, whence ($a_{i-1}$, $a_i$, $a_{i+1}$) is a stable tuple.\n\nNext we can see that replacing an element in a stable tuple with a stable subtuple whose sum of elements equals to the element removed always leads to a stable tuple. For that, let the original tuple be $(a_1, \\dots, a_n)$ and let $a_i$ be replaced with $b_1, \\dots, b_m$. If $n=1$ then the claim is trivial, hence assume that $n > 1$. Consider an arbitrary subtuple starting from the beginning of the whole tuple. If either no substituted elements are included or all substituted elements are included then the sum falls to the right side of zero by assumptions. If the subtuple ends with some $b_j$ then the sum of its elements is $a_1 + \\dots + a_{i-1} + b_1 + \\dots + b_j$. By stability of $(b_1, \\dots, b_m)$, the sum $b_1 + \\dots + b_j$ falls to the same side from zero as $a_i$ and $b_{j+1} + \\dots + b_m$. Hence $b_1 + \\dots + b_j$ falls between 0 and $a_i$. As $a_1 + \\dots + a_{i-1}$ and $a_1 + \\dots + a_{i-1} + a_i$ fall to the same side from zero, also $a_1 + \\dots + a_{i-1} + b_1 + \\dots + b_j$ falls to the same side. Similarly, we can show the desired property for subtuples taken from the end of the tuple.\n\nLastly, we show by induction on $k$ that any interesting $(2k+1)$-tuple contains at least $k$ stable subtuples containing more than one element. If $k = 0$ then the claim holds trivially. Suppose that $k > 0$ and the claim holds for $k - 1$. Find a stable subtuple of 3 elements in the given $(2k + 1)$-tuple. After replacing these three elements with their sum, we get a $(2(k − 1) + 1)$-tuple that is clearly stable. By stability of the 3-tuple replaced, the sum of its elements falls to the same side from zero as its first and third element, hence the alternation of signs is also maintained. By the induction hypothesis, the new tuple contains at least $k-1$ stable subtuples of more than one element. After substituting the removed elements back, each of these $k$-stable subtuples remains stable. Moreover, the 3-tuple itself will be the desired $k$th stable subtuple.\n\nIt remains to show that there are interesting $(2k+1)$-tuples that contain no more than $k$ stable subtuples. For example, let $a_i = (-\\frac{1}{2})^i$ for $i = 1, \\dots, 2k$ and $a_{2k+1} = -\\frac{1}{3}$. The sum of the first $2j$ elements is $-\\frac{1-\\frac{1}{4j}}{3}$ that is negative. Thus also the sum of $2j+1$ elements is always negative. As $a_2 + \\dots + a_{2k} = -\\frac{1-\\frac{1}{4k}}{3} + \\frac{1}{2} < \\frac{1}{3}$, also all sums of consecutive elements taken from the end are negative. Thus the tuple is stable.\n\nConsider any subtuple $(a_u, \\dots, a_v)$ where $u < v \\le 2k$. If $u$ and $v$ have different parity then the subtuple is not stable (every interesting tuple must have an odd number of elements). If $u$ and $v$ are both odd then $a_u + a_{u+1} < 0$ while $a_{v-1} + a_v > 0$. The case with $u$ and $v$ both even is analogous.

The triangles of the first type can be divided into four categories according to the position. We count first the triangles with the right angle at the upper left corner. Each subsquare of size $k \\times k$ contains exactly one triangle with leg $k$ of this kind. So we count the number of $k \\times k$ subsquares. The number of $2011 \\times 2011$ subsquares is 1, there are $4 \\times 2010 \\times 2010$ subsquares and $(k+1)^2 (2011-k) \\times (2011-k)$ subsquares (since there are $(k+1)^2$ possible places for the upper left corner. So the number of $k \\times k$ subsquares for $k = 1$ to $k = 2011$ equals\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{2010} (k+1)^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 + \\dots + 2011^2 = \\frac{1}{6} (2011 \\cdot 2012 \\cdot 4023)\n$$\n\nand the number of triangles of the first type is 4 times the previous number or\n\n$$\n2 \\cdot 2011 \\cdot 2012 \\cdot 1341 = 10851726024\n$$\n\nThe triangles of the second kind can similarly be divided into four categories according to the direction of the hypotenuse and the orientation of the right angle. We count those triangles for which the hypotenuse is vertical and the right angle is on the left. Consider a triangle with hypotenuse of length $k$. Its altitude from the vertex with the right angle is $\\frac{k}{2}$. If $k$ is even, $k = 2j$, the vertex with a right angle can be on any of the $2012-j$ leftmost vertical lines while on any such line the hypotenuse has $2012-k$ possible positions. So the number of such triangles is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} \\sum_{j=1}^{1005} (2012-j)(2012-2j) &= 2 \\sum_{j=1}^{1005} (2012-j)(1006-j) = 2 \\sum_{j=1}^{1005} j(1006+j) \\\\ &= 1006^2 \\cdot 1005 + \\frac{1}{3}(1005 \\cdot 1006 \\cdot 2011) = 1006 \\cdot (1005 \\cdot 1006 + 335 \\cdot 2011) = 1694823290. \\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIf, on the other hand, $k = 2j+1$, there are $2011-j$ vertical lines on which the hypotenuse can be, while on any such line the hypotenuse has $2012-k = 2011-2j$ possible positions. The number of possible triangles is then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} & \\sum_{j=0}^{1005} (2011-j)(2011-2j) \\\\ &= 1006 \\cdot 2011^2 - 6033 \\cdot \\frac{1005 \\cdot 1006}{2} + 2 \\cdot \\frac{1005 \\cdot 1006 \\cdot 2011}{6} = 1696340841. \\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSo the total number of triangles of the second type is $4 \\cdot (1694823290 + 1696340841) = 24416382548$.",

We add 1 to both sides and factor: $y^3 = x^4 + x^2 + 1 = (x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)$. We show that the factors $x^2 + x + 1$ and $x^2 - x + 1$ are co-prime. Assume that a prime $p$ divides both of them. Then $p \\mid x^2 + x + 1 - (x^2 - x + 1) = 2x$. Since $x^2 + x + 1$ is always odd, $p \\mid x$. But then $p$ does not divide $x^2 + x + 1$, a contradiction. Since $x^2 + x + 1$ and $x^2 - x + 1$ have no prime factors in common and their product is a cube, both of them are cubes by a consequence of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Therefore, $x^2 + x + 1 = a^3$ and $x^2 - x + 1 = b^3$ for some non-negative integers $a$ and $b$.\n\nIf $x < 0$, we may write $x = -x'$ and obtain $x'^2 - x' + 1 = a^3, x'^2 + x' + 1 = b^3$, which is the same pair of equations with $a$ and $b$ interchanged. Therefore we only need to consider the case $x > 0$. The first equation implies that $a > x^{\\frac{2}{3}}$. But since clearly $b < a$ we get\n\n$$\nx^2 - x + 1 = b^3 \\leq (a-1)^3 = a^3 - 3a^2 + 3a - 1 \\leq a^3 - 3a^2 + 3a \\leq a^3 - 2a^2 = x^2 + x + 1 - 2a^2 < x^2 + x + 1 - 2x^{\\frac{4}{3}}\n$$\n\nwhen $2a^2 \\leq 3a^2 - 3a$, i.e. $a^2 \\geq 3a$ which holds for $a \\geq 3$. Clearly $a = 2$ is impossible and $a = 1$ means $x = 0$. We got $x^2 - x + 1 < x^2 + x + 1 - 2x^{\\frac{4}{3}}$ which means $0 \\leq 2x - 2x^{\\frac{4}{3}}$. Hence $x = 1$, but then $3$ would be a cube, a contradiction.\n\n\\textbf{Remark.} There are many ways to guess the factorization $x^4 + x^2 + 1 = (x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)$. Writing $x^4 + x^2 + 1 = (x^2 + 1)^2 - x^2$ we immediately obtain it. Another way to see it is to write $p(x) = x^4 + x^2 + 1$ and notice that $p(0) = 1 \\cdot 1, p(1) = 3 \\cdot 1, p(2) = 7 \\cdot 3$, so there probably is a quadratic factor $q(x)$ for which $q(0) = 1, q(1) = 3, q(2) = 7$ (clearly, there cannot be linear factors). It is easy to see then that $q(x) = x^2 + x + 1$ and to complete the factorization by long division. One more way is to write $x^4+x^2+1 = (x^2+ax+b)(x^2+cx+d)$ and compare the coefficients.\n\nIt is well-known that if $s$ and $t$ are co-prime integers whose product is a perfect $k$th power, then $s$ and $t$ both are perfect $k$th powers. The proof goes like this. Let $a = p_1^{\\alpha_1} \\dots p_h^{\\alpha_h}, b = q_1^{\\beta_1} \\dots q_l^{\\beta_l}$ and $x = r_1^{\\gamma_1} \\dots r_m^{\\gamma_m}$ be the prime factorizations of $a, b$ and $x$. In the prime factorization of $x^k$, every exponent is divisible by $k$, so the same must hold for the factorization of $st$. But $s$ and $t$ are co-prime, so the exponents of primes in $s$ and $t$ must be divisible by $k$. Therefore $s$ and $t$ are perfect $k$th powers.",

Thus, $x_2^2 + x_3^2 + \\dots + x_{2013}^2 = y_{2013}^2 - y_1^2$ is divisible by $a$ and (iii) holds.\n\nFinally, $y_{2012} \\equiv \\frac{(2b-1)^2+1}{2} \\equiv -1-2b \\pmod a$ and $x_{2013}^2 = y_{2013}^2 - y_{2012}^2 \\equiv (2b-1)^2 - (2b+1)^2 = -8b$.

Now $n \\ge 2$, there are $n+1$ rooks on an $n \\times n$-chessboard, and we are to prove that some pair of them does not attack each other. Observe that the box principle tells us that there has to be some column $C$ containing at least two rooks. As $C$ consists of $n$ cells only, there has to be some rook $y$ that is not in $C$. Evidently $y$ attacks at most one rook from $C$, for which reason there has to be a rook $x$ in $C$ not attacked by $y$. The rooks $x$ and $y$ are as desired and thereby the case $k=1$ is solved.\n\nLet us now prove the statement from the problem by induction on $n$. In the base case, $n=2$, we necessarily have $k=1$, so we already know that the claim holds. Now let some $n \\ge 3$ and some $k$ with $n > k \\ge 1$ be given and suppose that the claim holds with $n-1$ in place of $n$ and all relevant values of $k$. As the case $k=1$ has been considered already, we may even suppose $n > k > 1$. As there are $n$ columns and $kn+1$ rooks, the box principle implies that there exists some column $C$ containing at least $k+1$ rooks. So denoting the number of rooks in $C$ by $r$, we have $k+1 \\le r \\le n$ and consequently $(n-r)(r-k-1) \\ge 0$. Now let the $r$ lines, to which the rooks from $C$ belong, contain $b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_r$ rooks, respectively. Clearly\n\n\\[\nb_1 + b_2 + \\dots + b_r \\le nk + 1,\n\\]\n\nand, as\n\n\\[\nnk + 1 < nk + n + (n-r)(r-k-1) = r(n + k + 1 - r),\n\\]\n\nit follows that there has to be some $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, r\\}$ satisfying $b_i < n+k+1-r$, i.e. $b_i \\le n+k-r$. This means that there is line $D$ such that\n\n* some rook $x$ belongs to both $C$ and $D$, and\n* there are at most $r + (n + k - r) - 1 = n + k - 1$ rooks belonging to $C$ or $D$.\n\nRemoving $C$ and $D$ from the chessboard we obtain an $(n-1) \\times (n-1)$-board $S$ on which at least $(nk+1) - (n+k-1) = (n-1)(k-1) + 1$ rooks have been placed. Applying the induction hypothesis with $n-1$ and $k-1$ to this arrangement we find $k$ rooks $y_1, \\dots, y_k$ on $S$ no two of which attack each other. Now the $k+1$ rooks $x, y_1, \\dots, y_k$ are as desired, the induction is complete, and the problem solved.\n\n\\textbf{Remark.} Adding some obvious cases, one could also put the slightly weaker assumption $n \\ge k \\ge 0$ into the statement of the problem. This would allow to shorten the first paragraph of the above solution to saying: note that the case $k=0$ is trivial.",

Let us assume for a moment that $i < k+1$. Note that each of the $i$ columns $C_1, \\dots, C_i$ witnessing $(\\boxplus)_i$ contains at most $n$ rooks. Moreover, each of the remaining $n-i$ columns contains at most $k-i$ rooks, for otherwise one of them could play the r\\^ole of $C_{i+1}$ and thus give $(\\boxplus)_{i+1}$, contrary to the maximality of $i$. These considerations show that there are at most $in + (n-i)(k-i) = nk - i(k-i) \\le nk < nk+1$ rooks on the chessboard, which is a contradiction. We have thereby proved that $i = k+1$, i.e. that $(\\boxplus)_{k+1}$ holds.

For the sake of a contradiction we assume $i < k+1$. Let the rooks $x_{k+2-i}, \\dots, x_{k+1}$ be as described in $(*)_i$. Plainly they occupy $i$ rows, and, as the column $C_{k+1-i}$ has been chosen so as to contain at least $i+1$ rooks, there is a rook $x_{k+1-i}$ belonging to it but not to any of those rows. Now the rooks $x_{k+1-i}, \\dots, x_{k+1}$ witness the truth of $(*)_{i+1}$, which contradicts the supposed maximality of $i$. This proves $i = k+1$, and thereby that $(*)_{k+1}$ holds, which in turn solves the problem.\n\n\\textbf{Remark.} The number $kn+1$ appearing in the statement of the problem is optimal, i.e. one can place $kn$ rooks on an $n \\times n$-chessboard in such a way that among any $k+1$ of them there are two that attack each other.

If player $A$ can't make a move, $B$ wins. In other case, $A$ chooses a divisor $m$. Note that $m|n-m$ and $m < n-m$, because $m \\le \\frac{n}{3}$ as $n$ is odd. Therefore $B$ may choose $m$ (in particular can make a move) and pass a number $n-2m$ to player $A$. The number is odd and smaller than $n$, so the thesis is correct by induction.\nNow, let $n$ be even, but not a power of 2. In that case $n$ has an odd divisor greater than one. Player $A$ may choose an odd divisor and pass an odd integer to player $B$. Then we have a situation where $B$ starts with an odd integer, so $A$ has a winning strategy.\n\nConsider now $n = 2^k$ for positive integer $k$. Once again we'll prove it by induction. Thesis: for odd $k$ player $B$ has a winning strategy and for even $k$ player $A$ has a winning strategy. Base: for $k=1$ player $B$ has a winning strategy as $A$ can't make the first move. For $k=2$ player $A$ may win, passing 2 to player $B$. The step of induction is split to two parts:\n\n* Assume $A$ has a winning strategy for $2^k$, then player $B$ has one for $2^{k+1}$. Let $n = 2^{k+1}$. Player $A$ has to choose a divisor $2^l$ for $1 \\le l \\le k$. If he chooses $2^k$, he passes $n - 2^k = 2^k$ to player $B$. By induction player $B$ has a winning strategy. If $A$ chooses smaller divisor, passes an even integer, which is not a power of 2 as $2^k < n - 2^l < n = 2^{k+1}$. We have already proved that starting player (in that case $B$) has a winning strategy for such number.\n\n* Assume $B$ has a winning strategy for $2^k$, then player $A$ has one for $2^{k+1}$. Let $n = 2^{k+1}$. It is sufficient for player $A$ to choose a divisor $2^k$, then he passes number $2^k$ to $B$.

If all the moves are done with lines parallel to one side of the triangle, then the game will end after $n$ moves. Let's show that the number of moves cannot be smaller. There will be a move that colors the corner triangle, we can assume that this move is done, coloring all the bottom line of the triangle (it can only increase the number of black squares). Move order is irrelevant, if we do this move as the first move then in remaining $(n-1)$ moves we have to color black $(n-1)^2$ triangle.\n\nNow lets show that the game can last $3n - 2$ moves. If $n = 1$ then it is evident. Assume that we have proved it for $n = k$. For $n = k + 1$ we start the game with three moves A, B and C coloring two rightmost corners and the rightmost line. We have used 3 moves and reduced the field to the situation when $n = k$ (Fig. 4).\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Baltic_Way_SHL_2009-11_13-16_p192_data_e53f3e8ff7.png)\n\nFigure 4\n\nAt last we show that there cannot be more than $3n-2$ moves. If all $n$ lines parallel to one side of the triangle is colored then the game ends.

          "latex": "Clearly all vertices of the convex hull are some endpoints of the line segments. As the figure is connected, there are at most 4 different locations of the endpoints of line segments. Hence the convex hull is either a quadrilateral or a triangle. We can assume that there are exactly 4 different locations of the endpoints of the line segments, as having only 3 meeting points would imply that the convex hull is an equilateral triangle with side length 1 whose area $S = \\frac{1}{4}\\sqrt{3}$ is clearly not the maximum.\n\nTherefore, if the convex hull is a triangle then one of the endpoints of the line segments lies inside the triangle. We have the following three cases:\n\n* If all line segments meet inside the triangle then the convex hull consists of three triangles, each of which has two side lengths equal to 1. Let the angles between the line segments be $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$. As $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$ are all less than 180°, we obtain\n\n$$\nS = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sin \\alpha + \\sin \\beta + \\sin \\gamma) \\le \\frac{3}{2} \\sin \\frac{\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma}{3} = \\frac{3}{2} \\sin 120^{\\circ} = \\frac{3}{4}\\sqrt{3}\n$$\n\nby Jensen's inequality. The bound $\\frac{3}{4}\\sqrt{3}$ is achieved when all angles between the line segments are 120°.\n\n* If exactly two lines meet inside the triangle then the convex hull is a triangle with one side length equal to 1 and one more side length less than 2 by triangle inequality. Hence $S < \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2 = 1 < \\frac{3}{4}\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n* If exactly one line segment ends inside the triangle then the triangle has two sides of length 1, whence $S \\le \\frac{1}{2} < \\frac{3}{4}\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nIf the convex hull is a quadrilateral, all line segments end at some vertex of the quadrilateral. We have the following two cases:\n\n* If a line segment coincides with a diagonal of the quadrilateral then other two line segments must coincide with sides of the quadrilateral. So the convex hull consists of two triangles which both have two sides of length 1. Hence $S \\le 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 1 < \\frac{3}{4}\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n* If no line segment coincides with any diagonal then the line segments form 3 consecutive sides of the convex hull. Let the broken line formed by the line segments be ABCD. Consider two subcases:\n\n- If $\\angle ABC + \\angle BCD \\le 180^{\\circ}$ then, assuming w.l.o.g. that $\\angle ABC \\ge \\angle BCD$, point D lies either inside or on the boundary of the rhomboid $ABCB'$ with side length 1. Hence $S \\le 1 < \\frac{3}{4}\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n- If $\\angle ABC + \\angle BCD > 180^{\\circ}$ then rays AB and DC meet at some point E. Let $\\beta = \\angle EBC, \\gamma = \\angle BCE$ and $\\alpha = \\angle CEB$. Then $|EB| = \\frac{\\sin \\gamma}{\\sin \\alpha}$ and $|EC| = \\frac{\\sin \\beta}{\\sin \\alpha}$ by the law of sines in triangle EBC, and we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*} \nS &= \\frac{1}{2} (|EA| \\cdot |ED| - |EB| \\cdot |EC|) \\sin \\alpha \\\\ \n&= \\frac{1}{2} (|EB| + |EC| + 1) \\sin \\alpha \\\\ \n&= \\frac{1}{2} (\\sin \\alpha + \\sin \\beta + \\sin \\gamma) \\\\ \n&\\le \\frac{3}{2} \\sin \\frac{\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma}{3} = \\frac{3}{2} \\sin 60^{\\circ} = \\frac{3}{4}\\sqrt{3} \n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nby Jensen's inequality.\n\nConsequently, the maximum area of the convex hull is $\\frac{3}{4}\\sqrt{3}$.",

Indeed, if $d \\mid a$, $d \\mid b$, $d \\mid c$ then the exponent of $p$ in the canonical representation of each of the positive rational numbers $|a|^b$, $|b|^c$, $|c|^a$ is divisible by $d$. Hence the exponent of $p$ in the canonical representation of the product $|a|^b |b|^c |c|^a$ is divisible by $d$. As this product equals to $p$, we get $|d| = 1$.\n\nConsider now arbitrary prime number $q$ different from $p$. Let $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$ be the exponents of $q$ in the canonical representation of the positive integers $|a|, |b|, |c|$, respectively. Then $\\alpha b + \\beta c + \\gamma a = 0$ whereby not all exponents $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$ are positive because $\\gcd(a, b, c) = 1$. Consequently, if some of $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$ is positive then there must be exactly two positive exponents among $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$. W.l.o.g., assume $\\alpha > 0, \\beta > 0, \\gamma = 0$. Then $\\alpha b + \\beta c = 0$, implying $\\alpha|b| = \\beta|c|$. Hence $|b|$ divides $\\beta|c|$. As $q^\\beta$ divides $|b|$ while $q^\\beta$ is relatively prime to $|c|$, this implies $q^\\beta | \\beta$ and $q^\\beta \\le \\beta$ which is impossible. This means that actually $\\alpha = \\beta = \\gamma = 0$ and $|a|, |b|, |c|$ are all powers of $p$.\n\nHence the equation rewrites to $p^{\\alpha b} p^{\\beta c} p^{\\gamma a} = p$ where $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$ are now the exponents of $p$ in the canonical representation of $|a|, |b|, |c|$, respectively. This is equivalent to $\\alpha b + \\beta c + \\gamma a = 1$. By $\\gcd(a, b, c) = 1$, one of $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$ must be zero, and clearly, one of the summands $\\alpha b, \\beta a, \\gamma a$ must be positive. W.l.o.g., let $\\alpha b > 0$, i.e., $\\alpha > 0$ and $b > 0$. Now there are three cases.\n\n* If $\\beta = 0$ and $\\gamma = 0$ then $b = 1$ and $|c| = 1$. Furthermore, $\\alpha b + \\beta c + \\gamma a = 1$ reduces to $\\alpha = 1$, whence $|a| = p$. If $p > 2$ then the exponents of $a$ and $c$ in the original equation, $b$ and $a$, are both odd, whence $a$ and $c$ must have the same sign to make the product $a^b b^c c^a$ positive. Both triples $(p, 1, 1)$ and $(-p, 1, -1)$ satisfy the original equation. If $p = 2$ then $c^a$ is positive anyway, hence $a$ must be positive. Both triples $(2, 1, 1)$ and $(2, 1, -1)$ satisfy the original equation.\n* If $\\beta = 0$ and $\\gamma > 0$ then $b = 1$. Furthermore, $\\alpha b + \\beta c + \\gamma a = 1$ reduces to $\\alpha + \\gamma a = 1$, whence $a < 0$. We obtain $p^\\alpha \\le \\gamma p^\\alpha = \\gamma|a| = \\alpha - 1 < \\alpha$ which is impossible.\n* If $\\beta > 0$ and $\\gamma = 0$ then $|c| = 1$. Furthermore, $\\alpha b + \\beta c + \\gamma a = 1$ reduces to $\\alpha b + \\beta c = 1$, which gives $c = -1$ and $\\alpha p^\\beta = 1 + \\beta$ as the only possibility. If $p > 2$ then this leads to contradiction similar to the previous case. If $p = 2$ then $\\alpha = \\beta = 1$ is the only solution. This leads to triples $(2, 2, -1)$ and $(-2, 2, -1)$ which both satisfy the original equation.",

The claim holds trivially for $n = 1$. Assume now that the claim holds for $n-1$ numbers.\n\nLet $s$ be the smallest among the $2^n$ sums and $s'$ be the second smallest. The sum $s$ is obviously obtained by the subset $N$ of all negative elements of $X$. In order to obtain $s'$ as the sum, some (possibly 0) negative elements are excluded and some (possibly 0) positive elements are included. It can be easily verified that the only possibility is either just excluding $x_0$ from $N$ if $x_0 \\in N$ or just including $x_0$ into $N$ if $x_0 \\notin N$ (other changes would increase the sum more). Hence $d = s' - s = |x_0|$.\n\nLeave $x_0$ out from $X$. Exactly half of all sums remain; other sums differ from corresponding sums by $|x_0|$ to the same direction. As $d = |x_0|$, this means that, in the arithmetic sequence of sums, exactly one member out of every two consecutive members is dropped. Thus the result is an arithmetic sequence with difference $2d$. By the induction hypothesis, $|x_i| = 2d \\cdot 2^{i-1} = d \\cdot 2^i$ for $1 \\le i < n$. Including $|x_0| = d = d \\cdot 2^0$ completes the induction step.\n\nTo prove the reverse direction, let $|x_i| = d \\cdot 2^i$ for $0 \\le i < n$. Consider two different subsets of $X$; suppose their elements sum up to the same number. Assume w.l.o.g. that these two subsets are disjoint. Then every $x_k$ that occurs in one or another subset can be expressed as a linear combination of others with coefficients 1 and $-1$. But if $x_k$ is the largest by absolute value term occurring in these two subsets then this is impossible since $|x_k| = d \\cdot 2^k > d \\cdot (2^0 + \\dots + 2^{k-1}) = |x_0| + \\dots + |x_{k-1}|$. Consequently, all subsets of $X$ have different sums of elements.\n\nLet $s$ and $t$ be the sums of all negative and all positive elements of $X$, respectively. Clearly, $s$ is the smallest and $t$ is the largest sum of elements of a subset. Their difference is\n\n$$\nt - s = |x_0| + \\dots + |x_{n-1}| = d \\cdot (2^0 + \\dots + 2^{n-1}) = d \\cdot (2^n - 1).\n$$\n\nAs all sums of elements of subsets are integral multiples of $d$, this implies that exactly $2^n$ of them lie on the interval $[s; t]$. By pairwise distinctness, sums of elements of all subsets of $X$ cover all integral multiples of $d$ between $s$ and $t$, hence forming an arithmetic sequence.",

First, note that each triangulated polygon can be bicoloured: The triangles may each be assigned either of two colours, black and white, in such a way that the colours alternate (i. e. adjacent triangles have opposite colours). This is easily shown inductively, since a triangulated polygon can be cut into two smaller ones across a diagonal.\n\nIt is clear that a triangulated polygon has an odd number of triangles incident at each vertex if and only if its edges are uniformly coloured in a single colour.\n\nWe now prove that, if $n$ is not divisible by 3 (which 2014 clearly isn't), there exists no triangulated $n$-gon having an odd number of triangles incident at each vertex. For, towards a contradiction, consider the smallest such $n$-gon, and, without loss of generality, suppose its edges to be black.\n\nWe first assume there exists a diagonal cutting the $n$-gon into two smaller polygons $P$ and $Q$, neither of which is a triangle. Say the two pieces have $p$ and $q$ vertices, respectively, where $p, q \\ge 4$ and $p+q-2=n$.\n\nSince the two triangles adjacent at the cutting line have opposing colours, one of the pieces, say $P$, will have received a black edge at the cut, and so will still have all its edges coloured black. The other, $Q$, will have a white edge exposed at the cut line, to which we now adjoin a black triangle. Call this augmented polygon $Q'$. Both $P$ and $Q'$ will then be bicoloured with black edges. Since $P$ and $Q'$ have $p < n$ and $q + 1 < n$ vertices, respectively, our hypothesis on the minimality of $n$ may be applied to show that both numbers $p$ and $q + 1$ are divisible by 3. But then so is $n = p + (q + 1) - 3$.\n\nHence all diagonals of the $n$-gon cut off a triangle.

This is only possible when $x^2 = 1$, a contradiction. We next show that the inequality $b \\ge 3$ also leads to a contradiction, and then investigate the remaining possibility $b = 2$.\n\nObserve that $ab+1$ is not a perfect square. (Indeed, if $ab+1 = z^2$, then $(2z)^2 - x^2 = 3$. As above, this is impossible, since $x \\ge 2$.) Also, $ab$ is not a perfect square. (If it is, then both $4ab$ and $4ab+1$ are perfect squares, which is impossible.) Thus, the smallest solution (often called a fundamental solution) of the Pell equation\n\n$$\nX^2 - abY^2 = 1\n$$\n\nin positive integers is $(X, Y) = (X_1, Y_1) = (x, 2)$.

By induction, then $g(x+kc) = c$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nWe show that $g$ only assumes one value. Since $g(0) = f(0)$, this value then has to be $f(0)$. Assume $g(x_0) = a$ for some $x_0$ and let $0 < b < a$. Set $d = a - b$. Now for $x_0 \\le x' < x_0 + d$ we have $f(x') \\ge f(x)$ and $g(x') = f(x') - x' > f(x_0) - (x_0 + d) = g(x) - d = a + b - a = b$. So $g$ does not take the value $b$ in the interval $[x_0, x_0 + d]$. Now assume that $g$ does not take the value $b$ in the interval $[x_0 + (k-1)d, x_0 + kd]$ for some $k \\ge 1$. Let $x' \\in [x_0 + kd, x_0 + (k+1)d]$. Then $x' + b \\in [x_0 + a + (k-1)d, x_0 + a + kd]$. But $g(x_0 + a) = a$, and the induction hypothesis, which can be applied to the situation where the $x$-axis has been shifted by $a$, shows that $f(x' + b)$ cannot be $b$. But if $f(x') = b$, then $f(x' + b) = b$. So $f$ does not take the value $b$ in $[x_0 + kd, x_0 + (k+1)d]$. By induction, $f$ does not take the value $b$ for any $x > x_0$. If $f(x_1) = b$, then $f(x_1 + kb) = b$ for all $k$, which clearly leads to a contradiction.\n\nThe assumption $f(x) > x$ might be removed, but the proof might be somewhat more complicated.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Baltic_Way_SHL_2009-11_13-16_p245_data_8ed0040e6c.png)",

Then at least one function $f_i$ is zero at $x = x_0$. If $T = T(f_i) > 0$ is a period of $f_i$, then $f_i(x_0 + kT) = f_i(x_0 + (k-1)T) = \\cdots = f(x_0) = 0$ for each $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Hence, $p(x_0 + kT) = 0$ for every $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. This is impossible, since $p$ cannot have infinitely many roots.\n\nAssume next that $p$ has no real roots. Consider a class $K$ of functions $\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that are nonconstants and can be written as $p_1/p_2$, where $p_1, p_2$ are polynomials with real coefficients having no real roots. (In particular, selecting $p_2 = 1$ and $p_1 = p$, we see that $p \\in K$.) We first claim that if $q(x) \\in K$ and $a > 0$, then $q(x+a)/q(x) \\in K$.\n\nTo prove the claim observe that if $q(x) = p_1(x)/p_2(x)$, then $q(x+a)/q(x)$ is a quotient of two polynomials without real roots $p_1(x + a)p_2(x)$ and $p_2(x + a)p_1(x)$. These two polynomials have the same degree and the same leading coefficient. Thus, if their quotient were equal to a constant $c$ (for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$), then $c = 1$, and so $q(x+a) = q(x)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Then, $q(x + ka) = q(x)$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, so, in particular, $q(ka) = q(0)$. This implies that the polynomial $p_2(x)(q(x) - q(0))$ has a root at $x = ak$ for each $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. This is only possible when $q(x) - q(0) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Thus, $q(x)$ is a constant. Then, by the definition of $K$, $q \\notin K$, a contradiction. This completes the proof of the claim.\n\nNow, by induction on $m$, we will show that no $q \\in K$ can be expressed by a product of $m$ periodic functions. Firstly, by the above claim, each $q \\in K$ is not periodic, so $m$ cannot be 1. Assume that no $q \\in K$ can be expressed by a product of less than $m$ periodic functions, where $m \\ge 2$, but some $q \\in K$ can be written as $q(x) = f_1(x) \\cdots f_m(x)$ with some periodic functions $f_1, \\dots, f_m$. Select $a > 0$ as a period of $f_m$, so that $f_m(x + a) = f_m(x)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Dividing $q(x + a) = f_1(x + a) \\cdots f_m(x + a)$ by $q(x) = f_1(x) \\cdots f_m(x)$ (none of the functions $f_i$ is zero at a real $x$, since $q(x) \\ne 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$) we find that\n\n$$\n\\frac{q(x+a)}{q(x)} = \\frac{f_1(x+a)}{f_1(x)} \\cdots \\frac{f_{m-1}(x+a)}{f_{m-1}(x)}\n$$\n\nBy the above claim, the left hand side belongs to $K$ and is a product of $m-1$ periodic functions $f_i(x + a)/f_i(x)$, $i = 1, \\dots, m-1$, which is impossible, by our assumption. This completes the proof. \\(\\blacktriangleright\\)",

If Albert makes move a) from one bowl, Betty makes move a) from the other bowl. The only exception of this rule is if Betty can make a winning move, that is a move where she removes the last blue ball from the red bowl, or the last red ball from the blue bowl. In this case she makes her winning move.\n\nFirst we prove that it is possible to follow this strategy. Let\n\n$$\nb = (\\# \\text{blue balls in the blue bowl}, \\# \\text{red balls in the blue bowl})\n$$\n\n$$\nr = (\\# \\text{red balls in the red bowl}, \\# \\text{blue balls in the red bowl}).\n$$\n\nAt the beginning $b = r = (100, 0)$. If $b = r$ and Albert takes a move b), then it must be possible for Betty to take a move c) and again leave a situation where $b = r$ to Albert. The same happens when Albert takes a move c). If $b = r$ and Albert takes a move a) from one bowl, then it is possible for Betty to take a move a) from the other bowl and again leave a situation where $b = r$. Hence by following this strategy Betty always leaves a situation to Albert where $b = r$ if she is not taking a winning move.\n\nNow we prove that using this strategy Betty wins. Assume that at some point Albert wins, that is he takes a winning move. Since $r = b$ before the move, we must have $b = r = (1, s)$, $s \\ge 1$, or $b = r = (2, t)$ before the move. But that means that either $b$ or $r$ was $(1, s)$, $s \\ge 1$, or $(2, t)$ when Betty made her last move, but that is a contradiction because in this situation Betty would have taken a winning move, and the game would have stopped. Hence Betty wins.\n\nNotice that there is one situation from which no legal move is possible, and that is $b = r = (1, 0)$. When Betty follows the above strategy, this situation will never occur.",

Prove that $G$ also has a Hamiltonian cycle.\n\n**Possible adaptation.** There are 100 cities in some country. Some pairs of cities are connected by (two-sided) flights of the company \"Super-Air\". The number of \"Super-Air\" flights that start in the city is called its importance. The company \"Concur-Air\" establishes (two-sided) flights between every two cities whose total importance is at least 100. It happens that there exists closed round trip of \"Concur-Air\" flights that visit one time every city in the country. Prove that \"Super-Air\" has an analogous round trip also.\n\n**Lemma.** Let a graph $H$ has 100 vertices and contains a Hamiltonian path (not cycle) that starts at the vertex $A$ and ends in $B$.

Hence the amount of laundry post-wash after the $n$th week is bounded above by the sequence $a_{n+1} = \\frac{2}{3}(a_n + K)$ with $a_0 = 0$, which is clearly bounded above by $2K$. The total amount of laundry is less than $2K$ post-wash and $3K$ pre-wash.\n\nNow suppose pre-wash state $(a, b, c)$ precedes post-wash state $(a, b, 0)$, which precedes pre-wash state $(a', b', c')$. The relations $a \\le c$ and $a' \\le a + K$ lead to\n\n$$\n3K > a + b + c \\ge 2a \\ge 2(a' - K),\n$$\n\nand similarly for $b'$, whence $a', b' < \\frac{5}{2}K$. Since also $c' \\le K$, a pre-wash bin, and a fortiori a post-wash bin, always contains less than $\\frac{5}{2}K$.\n\nConsider now the following scenario. For a start, we keep packing the three bins equally full before washing. Initialising at $(0, 0, 0)$, the first week will end at $(\\frac{1}{3}K, \\frac{1}{3}K, \\frac{1}{3}K)$ pre-wash and $(\\frac{1}{3}K, \\frac{1}{3}K, 0)$ post-wash, the second week at $(\\frac{5}{9}K, \\frac{5}{9}K, \\frac{5}{9}K)$ pre-wash and $(\\frac{5}{9}K, \\frac{5}{9}K, 0)$ post-wash, &c. Following this scheme, we can get arbitrarily close to the state $(K, K, 0)$ after washing. Supposing this accomplished, placing $\\frac{1}{2}K$ kg of laundry in each of the non-empty bins leaves us in a state close to $(\\frac{3}{2}K, \\frac{3}{2}K, 0)$ pre-wash and $(\\frac{3}{2}K, 0, 0)$ post-wash.
