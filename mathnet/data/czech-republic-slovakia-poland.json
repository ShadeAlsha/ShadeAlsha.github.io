From the equality $6x^2 - y^2 = 1$ it follows that the number $y$ is odd, hence $y^2$ gives a remainder of 1 upon division by 8. The number $6x^2$ then gives the remainder of 2, which implies that $3x^2$ gives remained 1 upon division by 4 — a contradiction. Hence in the case of $k = 4c+3$ the number $p$ is never a perfect square, and likewise the number $3k+1 = 12c+10$ is never a perfect square (being an even number not divisible by 4).\n\nLet us finally find the least number $k = 4c+1$, $c \\ge 1$, for which both numbers $2c+1$ and $3c+1$ are perfect squares. From the equalities $2c+1 = x^2$ and $3c+1 = y^2$ for suitable integers $x, y > 1$ it follows that $3x^2 - 2y^2 = 1$, whence $x$ is odd, but then the number $2y^2$ gives remainder 2 upon division by 4, so $y$ is also odd. Set $x = 2a+1$, $y = 2b+1$ ($a, b > 0$ integer) and substitute this into the equality $3x^2 - 2y^2 = 1$; upon a small manipulation this leads to the relation $3a(a+1) = 2b(b+1)$, and taking successively $a = 1, 2, \\dots$ we soon find the smallest solution $a = 4$ and $b = 5$, corresponding to $x = 9, y = 11, c = 40$ and $k = 161$.",

This leads us to studying the entire sum of distances of candies from one child, say Erika. We label the seats in clockwise direction by numbers $0, 1, \\dots, n-1$ (as the distance from Erika in this direction). After every round we sum up the distances of all candies. Let the sum be $S$ (i. e. with every candy we add to $S$ the number of the seat where the candy actually is). If in the given round Erika chooses child on the seat labeled by $k$, whereby $1 \\geq k \\geq n-2$, the value of $S$ does not change - we sum up $(k-1)+(k+1)$ instead of $2k$. If she chooses child on the seat labeled by $n-1$, we sum up $(n-2)+0$ instead of $2(n-1)$, hence $S$ decreases by $n$. Finally, if she chooses herself, we sum up $(n-1)+1$ instead of $2 \\cdot 0$, hence $S$ increases by $n$. At the beginning we have $S = 0$ and its value can change only by $\\pm n$, hence $S$ remains divisible by $n$ after every round. Thus $S/n$ is permanently integer. But in the case when every child has exactly one candy we have\n\n\\[\nS = 0 + 1 + 2 + \\dots + (n-1) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, \\quad \\text{i. e.} \\quad \\frac{S}{n} = \\frac{n-1}{2},\n\\]\n\nwhich is not integer for $n$ even. Hence such situation never happens.\n\nFor odd $n$ we show there is a distribution ending with every child having one candy. Let $n = 2k + 1$. We find proper distribution by induction. More precisely we prove that for every $i = 0, 1, \\dots, k$ we can get position with $n - 2i$ candies by Erika, one candy by first $i$ children sitting to the left side of her, and one candy by first $i$ children to the right. The value $i = 0$ represents the beginning of distribution, the value $i = 1$ the status after the first round (and thus the first step of induction), and the value $i = k$ the status we would like to reach. Suppose we managed to get the specified position for some value $i = m$ with $1 \\leq m < k$ (and we passed through all positions for $i < m$). From this status we proceed as follows. First Erika gives one candy to her neighbours (as $m < k$, she has at least three candies thus she can do it). The following rounds are illustrated in the scheme. (The numbers are for amounts of candies by Erika and children on the right side of her. On the left side we proceed simultaneously in the same way.)\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{l} \\underline{n-2m, 1, \\dots, 1, 0, \\dots} \\rightarrow \\underline{n-2m-2, 2, 1, \\dots, 1, 0, \\dots} \\rightarrow \\underline{n-2m, 0, 2, 1, \\dots, 1, 0, \\dots} \\rightarrow \\\\ \\rightarrow \\underline{n-2m, 1, 0, 2, 1, \\dots, 1, 0, \\dots} \\rightarrow \\underline{n-2m, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, \\dots, 1, 0, \\dots} \\rightarrow \\dots \\\\ \\dots \\rightarrow \\underline{n-2m, 1, \\dots, 1, 0, 2, 0, \\dots} \\rightarrow \\underline{n-2m, 1, \\dots, 1, 0, 1, 0, \\dots} \\\\ \\qquad \\rightarrow \\underline{m-1} \\end{array}\n\\]\n\nWe get the status, when Erika has $n-2m$ candies, first $m-1$ children on both sides have one candy, the $m$-th children have no candy, and the $(m+1)$-st children have one candy. To reach the position for $i=m+1$, it is sufficient to deliver candies to the children on the $m$-th seats. But here we can use induction hypothesis. That is if we look apart from candies on the $(m+1)$-st seats, we obtain exactly the position for $i=m-1$ (Erika has two candies less, but she still has at least three and thus we can do the same steps). From this position we know how to proceed to the position for $i=m$. Restoring back prescinded candies we get the position for $i=m+1$.\n\nThus, finally we also reach the position for $i=k$.\n\n*Remarks.* For $n$ even but not divisible by $4$, it is possible to prove the statement more simply. In this case we can color the seats alternately white and black. It is obvious the parity of the sum of candies by children on white seats does not change. At the beginning this value is even, while it is odd in the situation when every child has one candy. Thus such situation is impossible.\n\nOne can even show for odd $n$ the distribution always ends (no matter how we choose children) with every child having one candy. When $n = 2k + 1$, the number of rounds needed to reach this is always $1^2 + 2^2 + \\dots + k^2$.",

To get at least $k$ zeros in $2^n$, this power must be of the form $y \\cdot 10^{m+k} + z$ with $y, z$ positive integers and $z$ having at most $m$ digits, i. e. $z < 10^m$. Thus it is sufficient to find $n, m$ with $2^n$ having residue less then $10^m$ modulo $10^{m+k}$. By Euler theorem for every positive integer $t$ we have (as $(2, 5^t) = 1$)\n\n\\[\n2^{\\varphi(5^t)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5^t}.\n\\]\n\nMultiplying by $2^t$ we obtain\n\n\\[\n2^{t+\\varphi(5^t)} \\equiv 2^t \\pmod{10^t}, \\quad \\text{thus} \\quad 2^{t+\\varphi(5^t)} \\equiv y \\cdot 10^t + 2^t\n\\]\n\nfor some positive integer $y$. By previous we set $n = t + \\varphi(5^t)$ and $m = t - k$. We would like to have $t$ with $2^t < 10^{t-k}$. Such a value of $t$ exists definitely, e. g. $t = 2k$ (since $2^{2k} = 4^k < 10^k$). It follows by presented, that in\n\n\\[\n2^{2k+\\varphi(5^{2k})} = y \\cdot 10^{2k} + 2^{2k}\n\\]\n\nthere is a block of at least $k$ zeros.\n\nLet us take (for a given $k$) power of 2 (say $2^n$) containing a block of exactly $r$ zeros with $r \\ge k$. We will study, what happens to this block when considering subsequent powers, i. e. when multiplying the number with block by 2. For some nonzero digits $a, b$ we have\n\n\\[\n2^n = \\underbrace{\\dots a \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ \\dots}_{y} \\underbrace{\\dots 0 \\ b \\ \\dots}_{r \\text{ zeros}} \\underbrace{\\dots}_{z} = y \\cdot 10^{r+s} + z.\n\\]\n\nThus $2^{n+1} = 2y \\cdot 10^{r+s} + 2z$. The number $2z$ has either the same number of digits as $z$, or one more. Hence at the \"right side\" the block of zeros either does not cut down, or cut down by one zero. At the \"left side\" the block can only extend (when $y$ divisible by 5). Globally the length of the block either decreases by 1, or does not change, or increases. Similarly when we will multiply by 2 again and again, the length of the block in every step decreases at most by 1. Thus the only possibility how to avoid block of length $k$ is to remain the length more then $k$. This is anyway impossible. Namely $y$ has in its prime factorization the prime 5 with some exponent, say $\\alpha$. When we $\\alpha$ times multiply $2^n$ by 2, under the next multiplying the block will not extend at the \"left side\". At the \"right side\" at least under every fourth multiplying the block cut down (since $2^4 > 10$).

This leads us to studying the entire sum of distances of candies from one child, say Erika. We label the seats in clockwise direction by numbers 0, 1, ..., n-1 (as the distance from Erika in this direction). After every round we sum up the distances of all candies. Let the sum be S (i. e. with every candy we add to S the number of the seat where the candy actually is). If in the given round Erika chooses child on the seat labeled by k, whereby $1 \\geq k \\geq n-2$, the value of S does not change - we sum up $(k-1)+(k+1)$ instead of 2k. If she chooses child on the seat labeled by n-1, we sum up $(n-2)+0$ instead of $2(n-1)$, hence S decreases by n. Finally, if she chooses herself, we sum up $(n-1)+1$ instead of $2 \\cdot 0$, hence S increases by n.

Hence such situation never happens.\n\nFor odd n we show there is a distribution ending with every child having one candy. Let n = 2k + 1. We find proper distribution by induction. More precisely we prove that for every i = 0, 1, ..., k we can get position with n - 2i candies by Erika, one candy by first i children sitting to the left side of her, and one candy by first i children to the right. The value i = 0 represents the beginning of distribution, the value i = 1 the status after the first round (and thus the first step of induction), and the value i = k the status we would like to reach. Suppose we managed to get the specified position for some value i = m with $1 \\leq m < k$ (and we passed through all positions for i < m). From this status we proceed as follows. First Erika gives one candy to her neighbours (as m < k, she has at least three candies thus she can do it). The following rounds are illustrated in the scheme.

To reach the position for $i=m+1$, it is sufficient to deliver candies to the children on the m-th seats. But here we can use induction hypothesis. That is if we look apart from candies on the $(m+1)$-st seats, we obtain exactly the position for $i=m-1$ (Erika has two candies less, but she still has at least three and thus we can do the same steps). From this position we know how to proceed to the position for $i=m$. Restoring back prescinded candies we get the position for $i=m+1$.\n\nThus, finally we also reach the position for $i=k$.\n\n*Remarks.* For n even but not divisible by 4, it is possible to prove the statement more simply. In this case we can color the seats alternately white and black. It is obvious the parity of the sum of candies by children on white seats does not change. At the beginning this value is even, while it is odd in the situation when every child has one candy. Thus such situation is impossible.\n\nOne can even show for odd n the distribution always ends (no matter how we choose children) with every child having one candy.

In some sense these three lines intersect \"in infinity\" in \"point\" $B_4$ and all points $B_i$ be collinear. To satisfy given conditions it suffices to find proper map, which maps \"point from infinity\" to particular point (and preserves all the other necessary properties, e. g. maps lines to lines etc.). Such a map is projection (fig. 4). Consider ordinary cartesian coordinate system in space. Pentagon $A_1A_2A_3A_4A_5 = U$ can be imbedded"

Let's see what happens now with the number $S$ after one move:\n\n* if Erica chooses a child sitting on a chair with the number $k$, $1 \\le k \\le n-2$, then $S$ will not change (instead of $2k$ we count in the sum $(k-1)+(k+1)$);\n* if Erica choose a child sitting on the chair with number $n-1$, then $S$ decreases by $n$ (instead of $2(n-1)$ we count in the sum $(n-2)+0$);\n* finally, in the case where Erika chooses itself, then $S$ increases by $n$ (instead of $2 \\cdot 0$ we count in the sum $(n-1)+1$).\n\nBecause in the initial situation we have $S=0$, then after any number of moves number $S$ will be divisible by $n$. But In a situation where every child has one candy, we have\n\n$$\nS = 0 + 1 + 2 + \\dots + (n-1) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\iff \\frac{S}{n} = \\frac{n-1}{2}\n$$\n\nand if $n$ is even that number is not integer. Such a situation is not possible.\n\nLet us now deal with the odd values of $n$. We show that there is a division that ends in such a way that each child has just one candy. Let $n = 2k+1$. Appropriate division is constructed by induction: more precisely, for each $i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, k$ we can divide the candies so that Erika has $n - 2i$ candies and $i$ children sitting on her left, and also $i$ children sitting on the right, has one candy.\n\nThe value $i=0$ represents the beginning of the division, the value $i=1$ state after the first round (and thus the first induction step) and the value $i=k$ the final state where each one has one candy.\n\nSuppose we managed to get to division of candies described for some value $i = m$, which is $1 \\le m < k$ (and we have done all divisions for $i < m$). From this situation proceed as follows. First, Erika gives the candy to two of his neighbors (since $m < k$ he has at least three candies and can do it).\n\nThe other moves are shown in the diagram (numbers mean the number of candies at Erika and children to the right of it, we proceed at the same time and symmetrically, i.e. we assume\nthat if a given child moves on chairs with the number $\\ell \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, k-1\\}$, then in the next move the same is done by the child sitting on the chair with the number $n-\\ell$):\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*} & \\underline{n-2m, \\underbrace{1, \\dots, 1}_{m}, 0, \\dots} \\rightarrow \\\\ & n-2m-2, \\underline{2, \\underbrace{1, \\dots, 1}_{m-1}, 0, \\dots} \\rightarrow \\\\ & n-2m, 0, \\underline{2, \\underbrace{1, \\dots, 1}_{m-2}, 0, \\dots} \\rightarrow \\\\ & n-2m, 1, 0, \\underline{2, \\underbrace{1, \\dots, 1}_{m-3}, 0, \\dots} \\rightarrow \\\\ & n-2m, 1, 1, 0, \\underline{2, \\underbrace{1, \\dots, 1}_{m-4}, 0, \\dots} \\rightarrow \\\\ & \\dots \\\\ & n-2m, \\underbrace{1, \\dots, 1}_{m-2}, 0, \\underline{2, 0, \\dots} \\rightarrow \\\\ & n-2m, \\underbrace{1, \\dots, 1}_{m-1}, 0, 1, \\underline{0, \\dots} \\end{align*}\n$$\n\nWe got to the position when Erika has $n-2m$ of candies, the first $m-1$ children to the right and to the left have one candy, $m$-th child on both sides has no candy and children are distant $m+1$ places have one candy.\n\nTo get a situation corresponding to the case $i = m+1$, you should give candy child sitting on chair with number $m$.\n\nPerforming an analogous sequence of moves as above, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*} & \\underline{n-2m, \\underbrace{1, \\dots, 1}_{m-1}, 0, 1, 0, \\dots} \\rightarrow \\\\ & \\dots \\\\ & n-2m, \\underbrace{1, \\dots, 1}_{m-2}, 0, 1, 1, 0, \\dots \\rightarrow \\\\ & \\dots \\\\ & n-2m, \\underbrace{1, \\dots, 1}_{m-3}, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, \\dots \\rightarrow \\\\ & \\dots \\\\ & n-2m, 0, \\underbrace{1, \\dots, 1}_{m}, 0, \\dots \\rightarrow \\\\ & n-2m-2, \\underline{1, \\dots, 1, 0, \\dots}_{m+1} \\rightarrow \\end{align*}\n$$\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/CzsMT2006_sol_p3_data_67235366d1.png)\n\nSolution by Oliver Geupel, Br\\\"uhl, NRW, Germany.\n\nThe redistribution is possible if and only if $n$ is odd.\n\nTo prove this, let $\\mathbb{N}$ be the set of positive integers, and let $\\mapsto$ denote the binary relation on $\\mathbb{N}^n$ such that $(a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n) \\mapsto (a'_1, a'_2, \\dots, a'_n)$ if and only if there is an index $k$ such that $a'_{k-1} = a_{k-1} + 1$, $a'_k = a_k - 2$, and $a'_{k+1} = a_{k+1} + 1$, where indices are taken modulo $n$, that is, $a_{k+n} = a_k$.\n\nFirst, assume that\n\n$$\n(n, 0, 0, \\dots, 0) = (a_1^{(0)}, a_2^{(0)}, \\dots, a_n^{(0)}) \\mapsto (a_1^{(1)}, a_2^{(1)}, \\dots, a_n^{(1)}) \\\\ \\mapsto \\dots \\mapsto (a_1^{(m)}, a_2^{(m)}, \\dots, a_n^{(m)}) = (1, 1, \\dots, 1)\n$$\n\nFor $1 \\le k \\le n$, let $b_k$ denote the number of indices $j \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, m\\}$ such that $a_k^{(j)} = a_k^{(j-1)} - 2$. Then, for $2 \\le k \\le n$, the number of indices $j \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, m\\}$ such that $a_k^{(j)} = a_k^{(j-1)} + 1$ is $a_k^{(m)} - a_k^{(0)} + 2b_k = 2b_k + 1$, and on the other hand is $b_{k-1} + b_{k+1}$, since an increase in the $k$th component results from a decrease of a neighbour. Hence, $b_{k+1} = 2b_k - b_{k-1} + 1$, for $2 \\le k \\le n$. By induction one has\n\n$$\nb_{k+1} = kb_2 - (k-1)b_1 + \\frac{k(k-1)}{2}\n$$\n\nHence,\n\n$$\nb_1 = b_{n+1} = nb_2 - (n-1)b_1 + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n$$\n\nand thus $b_1 = b_2 + (n - 1)/2$. Consequently, $n$ is odd.\n\nFor convenience, let $a^k$ denote the sequence $a, a, \\dots, a$ consisting of $k$ occurrences of the symbol $a$, and let $\\mapsto^+$ denote the transitive closure of the relation $\\mapsto$.\n\nWe will show by mathematical induction that for each $k > 0$ there is a path $(0^k, 2k+1, 0^k) \\mapsto^+ (1^{2k+1})$ such that both the first and the last component of our $n$-tuple have only one increasing step each. The statement is obvious for $k=1$. Assume it holds for $k$. We obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*} (0^{k+1}, 2k+3, 0^{k+1}) &\\mapsto^+ (0, 1^k, 3, 1^k, 0) && \\text{(by hypothesis)} \\\\ &\\mapsto^+ (1, 0, 1^{k-1}, 3, 1^{k-1}, 0, 1) && \\text{(shift from the centre outwards)} \\\\ &\\mapsto^+ (1^2, 0, 1^{k-2}, 3, 1^{k-2}, 0, 1^2) && \\text{(shift from the centre outwards)} \\\\ &\\mapsto^+ \\dots \\mapsto^+ (1^{k+3}) && \\text{(iterate shifting from the centre outwards)} \\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis completes the proof. $\\square$\n",

Then, for $2 \\le k \\le n$, the number of indices $j \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, m\\}$ such that $a_k^{(j)} = a_k^{(j-1)} + 1$ is $a_k^{(m)} - a_k^{(0)} + 2b_k = 2b_k + 1$, and on the other hand is $b_{k-1} + b_{k+1}$, since an increase in the $k$th component results from a decrease of a neighbour. Hence, $b_{k+1} = 2b_k - b_{k-1} + 1$, for $2 \\le k \\le n$.

Consequently, $n$ is odd.\n\nFor convenience, let $a^k$ denote the sequence $a, a, \\dots, a$ consisting of $k$ occurrences of the symbol $a$, and let $\\mapsto^+$ denote the transitive closure of the relation $\\mapsto$.\n\nWe will show by mathematical induction that for each $k > 0$ there is a path $(0^k, 2k+1, 0^k) \\mapsto^+ (1^{2k+1})$ such that both the first and the last component of our $n$-tuple have only one increasing step each.

For a number $2^n$ to have at least $k$ zeros in its decimal representation, it must be formed $y \\cdot 10^{m+k} + z$, where $y$ and $z$ are positive integers and $z$ has at most $m$ digits, i.e. $z < 10^m$.\n\nSo it is enough to choose $n, m$ such that the number $2^n$, after division by $10^{m+k}$, gives a remainder less than $10^m$. By Euler's theorem, for every positive integer $t$ we have\n\n$$\n2^{\\varphi(5^t)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5^t}\n$$\n\nbecause $\\text{gcd}(2, 5) = 1$. Multiplying both sides by $2^t$ we get\n\n$$\n2^{t+\\varphi(5^t)} \\equiv 2^t \\pmod{10^t} \\Leftrightarrow 2^{t+\\varphi(5^t)} = y \\cdot 10^t + 2^t\n$$\n\nfor a positive integer $y$. Let $n = t + \\varphi(5^t)$ and $m = t - k$. It is enough now to take, for example, $t = 2k$, in order to satisfy the condition $2^t < 10^{t-k}$, since $2^{2k} = 4^k < 10^k$.\n\nConsequently, the number\n\n$$\n2^{2k+\\varphi(5^{2k})} = y \\cdot 10^{2k} + 2^{2k}\n$$\n\nhas a sequence of at least $k$ zeros in its decimal representation.\n\nLet's now look at a power of 2 with exactly $r$ zeros in its decimal representation, $r \\ge k$, and let's see what happens if we multiply this number by 2. If\n\n$$\n2^n = \\underbrace{\\dots a}_{y} \\underbrace{00 \\dots 0}_{r} \\underbrace{b \\dots}_{z} = y \\cdot 10^{r+s} + z\n$$\n\nthen\n\n$$\n2^{n+1} = 2y \\cdot 10^{r+s} + 2z\n$$\n\nNumber $2z$ has either the same number of digits as $z$, or one digit more. So, \"on the right\" the zero sequence does not change either has a zero less. Therefore \"on the left\", the zero sequence can only increase and this happen only if $y$ is divisible by 5.\n\nIn summary, after multiplying by 2, the number of zeros will either be reduced by one, or will not change, or increases.\n\nLet's now take the number $2^n$ constructed above. Multiplying by 2 many times, the length of zeros block decreases at most by one at any step.\n\nIf among the numbers constructed in this way there was no one with the exact string of $k$ zeros in its expansion, then all these numbers would have a string of at least $k+1$ zeros in its\nexpansion. But it is impossible: let $\\alpha$ be a non-negative integer such that $5^{\\alpha} | y$ and $5^{\\alpha+1} \\nmid y$. If we multiply $2^n$ by 2 for $\\alpha$ times, then the next multiplication by 2 will no longer extend the \"left hand\" of the zeros sequence, while after at most four multiplications the number of zeros will decrease by 1 in the right hand (since $2^4 > 10$). So, after an appropriate number of steps, we get a power of 2, which contains a block of exactly $k$ zeros. The proof if finished. $\\square$",

Therefore the point C lies outside the circle ABP. Analogously, D also lies outside that circle. It follows that P and Q lie on the same arc CD of the circle CDP.\n\nAnalogously, the points P and Q lie on the same arc AB of the circle ABP. Thus the point Q lies either inside the angle BPC or inside the angle APD. Without loss of generality assume that Q lies inside the angle BPC (Fig. 4). Then\n\n\\[\n|\\angle AQD| = |\\angle PQA| + |\\angle PQD| = |\\angle PBA| + |\\angle PCD| \\le 90^{\\circ}, \\quad (2)\n\\]\n\nunder the condition of the problem.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/CpsMT07_s_p4_data_023b03dc0e.png)\n\nFig. 4\n\nIn the chordal quadrilaterals APQB and DPQC, it follows from the hypothesis of the problem that the angles at the vertices A and D are acute. Thus the corresponding opposite angles at the vertex Q are obtuse. This implies that Q lies not only inside the angle BPC but in fact inside the triangle BPC, hence also inside the quadrilateral ABCD.\n\nFrom the properties of the angles in the two chordal quadrilaterals just mentioned it thus follows that\n\n\\[\n|\\angle BQC| = |\\angle PAB| + |\\angle PDC|,\n\\]\n\nso by the hypothesis of the problem\n\n\\[\n|\\angle BQC| \\le 90^{\\circ}. \\qquad (3)\n\\]\n\nMoreover, since $|\\angle PCQ| = |\\angle PDQ|$, we get by (1)\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned} |\\angle ADQ| + |\\angle BCQ| &= |\\angle ADP| + |\\angle PDQ| + |\\angle BCP| - |\\angle PCQ| \\\\ &= |\\angle ADP| + |\\angle BCP|. \\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nThe last sum is equal to $|\\angle APB|$, according to the observation (1) applied to $T = P$. Since also $|\\angle APB| = |\\angle AQB|$, we obtain\n\n\\[\n|\\angle ADQ| + |\\angle BCQ| = |\\angle AQB|.\n\\]\n\nThis however means, as we have seen in the beginning, that the circles BCQ and DAQ are externally tangent at Q, contradicting our initial assumption that $P \\neq Q$. Thus it has to be the case that the circumcircles of the two triangles ABP and CDP have only the single point P in common, for which, by the inequalities (2) and (3), it is further true that the angles APD and BPC are not obtuse.\n\nConsider now the half-discs with diameters BC and DA constructed inwardly to the quadrilateral ABCD. Since the angles APD and BPC are not obtuse, these two half-discs lie entirely inside the circles BQC and AQD; and since these two circles are externally tangent, the two half-discs cannot have any other point than P in common. Denoting by M and N the midpoints of the sides BC and DA, respectively, it thus follows that $|MN| \\ge \\frac{1}{2}(|BC| + |DA|)$.\n\nOn the other hand, since $\\overline{MN} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\overline{BA} + \\overline{CD})$, we have $|MN| \\le \\frac{1}{2}(|AB| + |CD|)$. Thus indeed $|AB| + |CD| \\ge |BC| + |DA|$, as claimed.",

We identify the large square with $[0, m] \\times [0, m]$. If $k \\mid m-n$, then we first cut the $m \\times m$ square into the square $[0, n] \\times [0, n]$ and rectangles $[0, n] \\times [n, m]$ and $[n, m] \\times [0, m]$. These rectangles can trivially be cut into rectangles of dimension $1 \\times k$. If $k \\mid m+n$ and $r+n \\leq m$, then we cut $[0, m] \\times [0, m]$ into a square $[r, r+n] \\times [r, r+n]$ and\n\nrectangles $[0, r] \\times [0, n+r]$, $[r, m] \\times [0, r]$, $[r+n, m] \\times [r, m]$ and $[0, n+r] \\times [r+n, m]$ (they are well defined if $r+n \\le m$), each of which can be trivially cut into rectangles $1 \\times k$. Note that we have used the assumption $r+n \\le m$ here.\n\nNow we show that the conditions on $(k, m, n)$ are necessary. Suppose the smaller square is equal to $[p, p+n] \\times [q, q+n]$; by symmetry we may assume that $q \\ge 1$.\n\nFirst we show that $r+n \\le m$. Each unit square $[i, i+1] \\times [0, 1]$, where $i \\in \\{p, p+1, \\dots, p+n-1\\}$, is contained in some rectangle $1 \\times k$ coming from the cut. If we had $r+n > m$, then we would have $m-n < k$ and this would imply that each such rectangle would be \"level\", i.e., of the form $[t, t+k] \\times [0, 1]$. Let $S$ denote the union of these \"level\" rectangles and let $P(S)$ denote the area of $S$. Note that we have $n \\le P(S) \\le m$ and $P(S)$ is divisible by $k$. This contradicts $r+n > m$.\n\nNow we show that $k \\mid m-n$ or $k \\mid m+n$. Suppose that this is not true. The idea is to write an integer $a_{ij}$ in each unit square $[i-1, i] \\times [j-1, j]$, $1 \\le i, j \\le m$, in such a way that\n\n(a) for any rectangle $1 \\times k$ of the cut the sum of numbers lying inside equals 0,\n\n(b) the sum of all the numbers and the sum of the numbers lying inside the square $n \\times n$ are different.\n\nThe existence of such a sequence clearly yields the claim.\n\nA second idea is to work with the sequences $(a_{ij})$ of the form $a_{ij} = a_i b_j$, where $(a_i)_{i=1}^m$ and $(b_j)_{j=1}^n$ are $k$-periodic and\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{k} a_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} b_j = 0. \\qquad (1)\n$$\n\nThis implies (a); furthermore, (b) takes form\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{m} a_i \\cdot \\sum_{j=1}^{m} b_j \\neq \\sum_{i=p+1}^{p+n} a_i \\cdot \\sum_{j=q+1}^{q+n} b_j,\n$$\n\nor, by periodicity and (1),\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{r} a_i \\cdot \\sum_{j=1}^{r} b_j \\neq \\sum_{i=p+1}^{p+s} a_i \\cdot \\sum_{j=q+1}^{q+s} b_j, \\qquad (2)\n$$\n\nwhere $s$ denotes the remainder coming from the division of $n$ by $k$.\n\nIf $r=0$, then the left-hand side is 0. Furthermore, as $k \\nmid m-n$, we have $s > 0$; it suffices to take $a_{p+1} = a_{p+2} = \\dots = a_{p+s} = b_{q+1} = b_{q+2} = \\dots = b_{q+s} = 1$ and choose the remaining $a_i$'s and $b_j$'s so that the periodicity and (1) hold.\n\nSuppose then, that $r > 0$.

Let $A = \\{1, 2, \\dots, r\\}$, $B = \\{p+1, p+2, \\dots, p+s\\} \\pmod k$ denote the sets of indices appearing in the sums involving $(a_j)$. Note that we take the set $B$ modulo $k$. Consider two cases:\n\ni) $A \\cup B \\neq \\{0, 1, \\dots, k-1\\}$.

The vectors $\\mathbf{a} = \\overrightarrow{AB}$, $\\mathbf{b} = \\overrightarrow{BC}$, $\\mathbf{c} = \\overrightarrow{CD}$ and $\\mathbf{d} = \\overrightarrow{DA}$ obviously satisfy\n\\[\n\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b} + \\mathbf{c} + \\mathbf{d} = \\mathbf{0}. \\qquad (1)\n\\]\nSquaring the triangle inequalities\n\\[\n|\\mathbf{a}| + |\\mathbf{c}| \\geq |\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{c}|, \\quad |\\mathbf{b}| + |\\mathbf{d}| \\geq |\\mathbf{b} - \\mathbf{d}|, \\qquad (2)\n\\]\nsumming up and using the dot product, we get\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned} (|AB| + |CD|)^2 + (|BC| + |DA|)^2 &\\geq |\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{c}|^2 + |\\mathbf{b} - \\mathbf{d}|^2 \\\\ &= |\\mathbf{a}|^2 + |\\mathbf{b}|^2 + |\\mathbf{c}|^2 + |\\mathbf{d}|^2 - 2 \\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{c} - 2 \\mathbf{b} \\cdot \\mathbf{d} \\\\ &= |\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b}|^2 - |\\mathbf{c} + \\mathbf{d}|^2 - 2(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{d}) \\cdot (\\mathbf{b} + \\mathbf{c}) \\\\ &= 2|\\mathbf{AC}|^2 - 2 \\overline{\\mathbf{DB}} \\cdot \\overline{\\mathbf{BD}} = 2|\\mathbf{AC}|^2 + 2|\\mathbf{BD}|^2. \\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThus the desired inequality is proven. If it is an equality, then (2) must become equalities as well, hence $\\mathbf{c} = -p\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{d} = -q\\mathbf{b}$ for some positive real $p$ and $q$. Substituting this into (1) yields\n\\[\n(1 - p)\\mathbf{a} + (1 - q)\\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{0},\n\\]\nhence both $1-p$ and $1-q$ vanish. Thus $\\mathbf{c} = -\\mathbf{a}$ (and $\\mathbf{d} = -\\mathbf{b}$) which means that ABCD is a parallelogram.\n\nConversely, if ABCD is a parallelogram, then $|AB| = |CD|$, $|BC| = |DA|$ and thus the proved inequality verges into the well-known parallelogram equality, which itself follows from our solution if we take (2) as two obvious equalities.\n\nRemark. The conditions of the problem are satisfied by an one-parametric system of mutually non-similar parallelograms ABCD given by\n\\[\n|AB| = 1, |BC| = t \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\cos \\angle ABC = \\frac{t^2 - 1}{2t} \\quad (1 \\le t \\le 1 + \\sqrt{2}).\n\\]\nIndeed, by the law of cosines,\n\\[\n|AC|^2 = 1 + t^2 - 2t \\cdot \\frac{t^2 - 1}{2t} = 2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad |BD|^2 = 1 - t^2 + 2t \\cdot \\frac{t^2 - 1}{2t} = 2t^2,\n\\]\nhence $|AC| = \\sqrt{2}|AB|$ and $|BD| = \\sqrt{2}|BC|$ as required.",

Without loss of generality we may assume that $w_{2010} \\ge r_{2010} \\ge b_{2010}$. We show that the inequality $b_{2010} + r_{2010} > w_{2010}$ holds. Evidently, there exists a triangle with side lengths $w, b, r$ for the white, black and red side, respectively, such that $w_{2010} = w$. By\n\nthe conditions of the problem we have $b+r > w$, $b_{2010} > b$ and $r_{2010} > r$. From these inequalities it follows\n\n$$\nb_{2010} + r_{2010} > b + r > w = w_{2010}.\n$$\n\nSecondly we describe a sequence of triangles for which $w_j$, $b_j$, $r_j$ with $j < 2010$ are not the lengths of the sides of a triangle.

The circles intersect in two points $K$ and $L$. Let $M$ be the point on the circle $\\Gamma_1$ (different from $K$ and $L$) and the line $KM$ meets $\\Gamma_2$ again in $N$. Then $MN = ML$.\n\n*Proof.*\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/CpsMT11_sol_p1_data_1e90fc9c4e.png)\n\nFig. 1a\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/CpsMT11_sol_p1_data_2541ffbc36.png)\n\nFig. 1b\n\nFor this lemma it is sufficient to prove that the line $MS_2$ bisects the angle $\\angle NML$. Then in the reflection with respect to the line $MS_2$, $ML$ is the image of $MN$. The circle $\\Gamma_2$ and the point $M$ reflect to themselves, the point $L$ reflects to the point $N$ (the intersection point of $ML$ and $\\Gamma_2$). So the triangle $\\triangle MLN$ is isosceles (some considerations are needed according to the position of the point $M$).\n\nFirstly, let $M$ lies on the arc $\\widehat{KL}$ not containing the point $S_2$. As $S_2K = S_2L$, we directly have $\\angle KMS_2 = \\angle S_2ML$. Secondly, let $M$ lies on the arc $\\widehat{KL}$ containing point $S_2$. Let $R$ be an arbitrary point on the arc $\\widehat{KL}$ not containing the point $S_2$. Similarly as before $\\angle KRS_2 = \\angle S_2RL$, then using identical angles in the cyclic quadrilaterals $RS_2MK$ and $RLS_2M$ we obtain $\\angle NMS_2 = \\angle KRS_2 = \\angle S_2RL = \\angle S_2ML$. ■\n\nLet the perpendicular line from the point $E$ to the line $AB$ intersect the arc $\\widehat{BC}$ in the point $S$, $k_1$ be the circle centered in $A$ passing through $C$, $k_2$ be the circle centered in $B$ passing through $D$, $k$ be the circle passing through $A, B, C, D$. The line $SC$ intersects $k_1$ again in $C'$ and the line $SD$ intersects $k_2$ again in $D'$. Circles $k_1$ and $k$ meet in $C, C''$ and circles $k_2$ and $k$ meet in $D, D''$. Using the lemma we have $SC' = SC''$ and $SD' = SD''$. Let the circles $k_1$ and $k_2$ meet again in $E'$. Using a contradiction, we shall prove that $C'' = D'' = E'$.\n\nThe point $S$ lies on the chord $EE' \\perp AB$ of the circles $k_1$ and $k_2$. That means its powers to this two circles are equal. We know that $S$ bisects the arc $\\widehat{CD}$, so $SD = SC$ and consequently $SC'' = SC' = SD' = SD''$. If $D''$ and $C''$ are different points then the triangle $\\triangle SD''C''$ is isosceles and its altitude from $S$ passes through the circumcentre of $k$ and consequently (by the symmetry) the quadrilateral $CDD''C''$ is isosceles trapezoid ($SC = SD$). We can find points $A$ and $B$ as the intersection points of the axes of the segments $CC''$ and $DD''$ with $k$. But then also $ABCD$ is an isosceles trapezoid, $AB \\parallel CD$, which is a contradiction to the given $AB \\nparallel CD$.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/CpsMT11_sol_p1_data_9e402310e6.png)\n\nIf we denote $\\angle DE'S = \\angle SE'C = \\alpha$ and $\\angle AE'D = \\beta$ then $\\angle CE'D = 2\\alpha - \\beta$ because $2|\\widehat{CD}| = |\\widehat{AB}|$.

Let $R$ be an arbitrary point on the arc $\\widehat{KL}$ not containing the point $S_2$. Similarly as before $\\angle KRS_2 = \\angle S_2RL$, then using identical angles in the cyclic quadrilaterals $RS_2MK$ and $RLS_2M$ we obtain $\\angle NMS_2 = \\angle KRS_2 = \\angle S_2RL = \\angle S_2ML$. ■\n\nLet the perpendicular line from the point $E$ to the line $AB$ intersect the arc $\\widehat{BC}$ in the point $S$, $k_1$ be the circle centered in $A$ passing through $C$, $k_2$ be the circle centered in $B$ passing through $D$, $k$ be the circle passing through $A, B, C, D$. The line $SC$ intersects $k_1$ again in $C'$ and the line $SD$ intersects $k_2$ again in $D'$. Circles $k_1$ and $k$ meet in $C$, $C''$ and circles $k_2$ and $k$ meet in $D$, $D''$. Using the lemma we have $SC' = SC''$ and $SD' = SD''$. Let the circles $k_1$ and $k_2$ meet again in $E'$. Using a contradiction, we shall prove that $C'' = D'' = E'$.\n\nThe point $S$ lies on the chord $EE' \\perp AB$ of the circles $k_1$ and $k_2$. That means its powers to this two circles are equal. We know that $S$ bisects the arc $\\widehat{CD}$, so $SD = SC$ and consequently $SC'' = SC' = SD' = SD''$. If $D''$ and $C''$ are different points then the triangle $\\triangle SD''C''$ is isosceles and its altitude from $S$ passes through the circumcentre of $k$ and consequently (by the symmetry) the quadrilateral $CDD''C''$ is isosceles trapezoid ($SC = SD$). We can find points $A$ and $B$ as the intersection points of the axes of the segments $CC''$ and $DD''$ with $k$. But then also $ABCD$ is an isosceles trapezoid, $AB \\parallel CD$, which is a contradiction to the given $AB \\nparallel CD$.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/CzsMT2011_sol_p2_data_4cecdf28de.png)\n\nIf we denote $\\angle DE'S = \\angle SE'C = \\alpha$ and $\\angle AE'D = \\beta$ then $\\angle CE'D = 2\\alpha - \\beta$ because $2|\\widehat{CD}| = |\\widehat{AB}|$. Using $BD = BE'$ and $AC = AE'$ we compute the angles in the triangle $ABE'$:\n\n$$2\\alpha + \\beta = \\angle AE'C = \\angle ACE' = \\angle ABE'$$ $$4\\alpha - \\beta = \\angle BE'D = \\angle BDE' = \\angle BAE'$$\n\nwhich yields to\n\n$$\n180^{\\circ} = 2\\alpha + \\beta + 4\\alpha - \\beta + 4\\alpha = 10\\alpha\n$$\n\n$$\\text{and } \\angle ACB = 180^{\\circ} - \\angle AE'B = 180^{\\circ} - 4\\alpha = 108^{\\circ}.$$ □",

We transform this relation into\n\n$$\n\\tau(n) = 2\\varphi(n) - n. \\qquad (1)\n$$\n\nIf $n$ is even, then no even number is relatively prime to $n$, thus $\\varphi(n) \\le \\frac{1}{2}n$. But then from (1) we get $\\tau(n) \\le 0$, which is impossible. Therefore, $n$ must be odd. Then (1) implies $\\tau(n)$ must be odd as well, which means $n$ is a perfect square (of an odd number). Write the prime factorization of $n$ in the form\n\n$$\nn = p_1^{2\\alpha_1} \\cdots p_k^{2\\alpha_k}, \\quad k \\ge 1, \\ p_i \\ge 3, \\ \\alpha_i \\ge 1.\n$$\n\n\\textsuperscript{1} it contains exactly one half in case $n$ is not a perfect square.\n\nApplying the well-known formula for $\\tau(n)$ and $\\varphi(n)$, we rewrite (1) as\n\n$$\n(2\\alpha_1 + 1) \\cdots (2\\alpha_k + 1) = 2p_1^{2\\alpha_1-1}(p_1-1) \\cdots p_k^{2\\alpha_k-1}(p_k-1) - p_1^{2\\alpha_1} \\cdots p_k^{2\\alpha_k} = \\\\ = p_1^{2\\alpha_1-1} \\cdots p_k^{2\\alpha_k-1}(2(p_1-1) \\cdots (p_k-1) - p_1 \\cdots p_k).\n$$\n\nThe right hand side is divisible by $p_1^{2\\alpha_1-1} \\cdots p_k^{2\\alpha_k-1}$, and so must be the left hand side as well. From this, we obtain\n\n$$\np_1^{2\\alpha_1-1} \\cdots p_k^{2\\alpha_k-1} \\le (2\\alpha_1 + 1) \\cdots (2\\alpha_k + 1). \\quad (2)\n$$\n\nHowever, for every integers $p \\ge 3$ and $\\alpha \\ge 1$, the inequality $p^{2\\alpha-1} \\ge (2\\alpha + 1)$ holds, with equality only for $p = 3$ and $\\alpha = 1$. To prove this, we use induction on $\\alpha$: The case $\\alpha = 1$ is trivial (with equality only for $p = 3$) and when $\\alpha$ increases by 1, the right hand size increases by 2, while the left hand size increases by 1.\n\n$$\np^{2(\\alpha+1)-1} - p^{2\\alpha-1} = p^{2\\alpha-1}(p^2 - 1) > 2.\n$$\n\nTherefore, each of the (positive) factors on the left hand side of (2) is greater or equal than the corresponding factor on the right hand side. The only possible way to satisfy (2) is to put $k = 1$, $p_1 = 3$, $\\alpha_1 = 1$, that is, $n = 9$. Indeed, we have $\\tau(9) = 3$ and $\\varphi(9) = 6$, thus (1) holds for $n = 9$.\n\n**Answer.** The given condition is fulfilled for $n \\in \\{1, 4, 6, 9\\}$.",

If an arrow has the same direction as the street WS or WN (that is, it runs from the upper left to the bottom right or from the bottom left to the upper right), it is called a forward arrow, otherwise it is a back arrow.\n\nIn the solution we will use the following obvious lemma: Let the set of all crossroads be split into two sets $A$ and $B$ such that $W \\in A$ and $E \\in B$. Then the number of times the car drives along an arrow from $A$ to $B$ is one more than the number of times the car drives along an arrow from $B$ to $A$.\n\nLet us split the set of all crossroads of Mar del Plata into two sets $A$ and $B$ by a vertical (i.e. north-south) line connecting two points located $100k + 50\\ \\mathrm{m}$ from $W$ – one on the WN street and one on the WS street – for some $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$.

Since $C$ is the midpoint of the arc $BD$, we have $\\angle(CD, p) = \\angle CAD = \\angle BAC = \\angle BDC$, and we see that $p$ is tangent to $\\omega$.

Thus the line $q$ symmetric to $p$ with respect to $CE$ is tangent to $\\omega$ and $\\omega'$ (Fig. 2).

Consider the sequence $(x_n)_{n=0}^{\\infty}$ such that $x_{n+1}$ is formed by the last four digits of $a(x_n + b)$ for each $n \\ge 0$, that is,\n\n$$\nx_{n+1} \\equiv a(x_n + b) \\pmod{10\\,000} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 0 \\le x_{n+1} < 10\\,000.\n$$\n\nSince there are only finitely many different possible values for $x_n$ and each term is only dependent on the value of the previous term, the sequence must be periodic, with the period starting in the term whose value first occurs for the second time in the sequence.\n\nIn general, the period does not have to start with $x_0$ (e. g., if we take $x_0 = 1$, $a = 10$, and $b = 10$, then all the terms except $x_0$ ends with zero, hence the value of $x_0$ never occurs again). However, consider the special case when $a$ is coprime with $10\\,000$. We claim that then the period starts with $x_0$. In fact, suppose that $x_n$ is the first term of the sequence whose value occurs again, say $x_m = x_n$, $m > n$. If $n > 0$, the equality can be rewritten as $a(x_{n-1} + b) \\equiv a(x_{m-1} + b) \\pmod{10\\,000}$, that is,\n\n$$\n10\\,000 | a(x_{n-1} + b) - a(x_{m-1} + b) = a(x_{n-1} - x_{m-1}).\n$$\n\nSince $a$ is coprime with $10\\,000$, we have $10\\,000 | x_{n-1} - x_{m-1}$, implying $x_{n-1} = x_{m-1}$. But this is in contrary with the assumption $x_n$ was the first term whose value repeats.\n\nThe previous paragraph suggests the algorithm how to display the requested number infinitely many times: We only need to produce the number once, using buttons with $a$ coprime with $10\\,000$, and then repeat the sequence $+b, \\cdot a, +b, \\cdot a, \\dots$ forever. In case we get the requested number with even number of presses, i. e., ending with addition, repeating the sequence $\\cdot a, +b, \\cdot a, +b, \\dots$ will do the same desired effect.\n\nThere are many ways how to display 2015 using only few presses. E. g., we can try to find $a, b$ such that $(1 \\cdot a + b) \\cdot a = 2015$. Since $2015 = 5 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 31$, we can take $a = 31$ and $b = 5 \\cdot 13 - a = 65 - 31 = 34$. Indeed, we will get\n\n$$\n1 \\xrightarrow{\\cdot 31} 31 \\xrightarrow{+34} 65 \\xrightarrow{\\cdot 31} 2015.\n$$\n\nNotice that 31 is coprime with $10\\,000$. Therefore the (a) part is solved.\n\nIn the part (b), we analogously wish to generate the sequence $(x_n)$ described above with $x_0 = 5813$. However, it is not so easy to produce the initial occurrence of 5813 using only a few presses. Therefore, we shall instead produce $5813 + b$, knowing that performing the sequence $\\cdot a, +b, \\cdot a, \\dots$ afterwards will eventually reach $5813$. One possible way is to find $a, b$ according to the schema\n\n$$\n1 \\xrightarrow{\\cdot b} b \\xrightarrow{+b} 2b \\xrightarrow{\\cdot a} 2ab \\xrightarrow{+a} 2ab + a = 5813 + b.\n$$\n\nThe equation can be rewritten as $(2a-1)(2b+1) = 11625 = 3 \\cdot 5^3 \\cdot 31$. From there, we can easily deduce several 2-digit solutions, one of which is $a = 47, b = 62$. Since 47 is coprime with 10000, the procedure\n\n$$\n1 \\xrightarrow{\\cdot 62} 62 \\xrightarrow{+62} 124 \\xrightarrow{\\cdot 47} 5828 \\xrightarrow{+47} 5875 \\xrightarrow{\\cdot 47} - \\xrightarrow{+62} - \\xrightarrow{\\cdot 47} - \\xrightarrow{+62} \\dots\n$$\n\nwill reach numbers ending with $5875 - 62 = 5813$ infinitely many times.\n\n*Remark.* In fact, 5813 is the only 4-digit number that need at least 7 presses under the condition at least one of the numbers on the buttons is coprime with 10000. So trying to produce it directly from 1 may be painful. On the other hand, there are many other ways how to produce it in a similar fashion as described above. Here is the sketch of another solution:\n\n$$\n1 \\xrightarrow{\\cdot 89} 89 \\xrightarrow{+89} 178 \\xrightarrow{\\cdot 89} 15842 \\xrightarrow{+60} 15902 = 15813 + 89 \\xrightarrow{\\cdot 89+89} - \\xrightarrow{\\cdot 89+89} \\dots\n$$\n\n**Second solution.** One can construct a sequence in which every 4-digit number occurs infinitely many times. Consider the calculator with $a = 11$ and $b = 12$. Applying the same arguments as above, we deduce that if we keep pressing the first button (with number 11 on it, which is coprime with 10000), after a finite even number of presses we obtain a number ending with 0001 again. If we change the button in the very last operation, that is, we replace +11 with +12, we get a number ending with 0002. In the same way, we can always increment the number formed by the last 4 digits by 1 (or change 9999 to 0000). The conclusion follows.",

Since the ordering of the numbers $x, y, z$ is irrelevant and they can not be of the same sign because of (1), we can without the loss of generality assume $x > 0$, $y > 0$, and $z < 0$, and find the maximum value of $V = |x + y + z|$.\n\nWe can transform (1) equivalently to\n\\[\nf(x) + f(y) = f(t), \\quad \\text{where} \\quad t := -z > 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f(x) = x + \\frac{1}{x},\n\\]\nwith $x, y, t \\in I := (1, \\infty)$. In the following, we shall use the well known fact about the function $f$: It is an increasing bijection mapping $I$ onto $(2, \\infty)$ (the trivial proof is omitted here). Applying this, from\n\\[\nf(t) = f(x) + f(y) = x + \\frac{1}{x} + y + \\frac{1}{y} > x + y + \\frac{1}{x+y} = f(x+y)\n\\]\nwe get $t > x + y$, hence $x + y + z = x + y - t < 0$. Therefore our aim is to maximize the positive expression $V = |x + y + z| = t - x - y$.\n\nWe will call valid every triple $(x, y, t) \\in I^3$ satisfying $f(x) + f(y) = f(t)$. One of the valid triples is $(1, 1, t_0)$, with $t_0 > 1$ such that $f(t_0) = 4$, i. e., $t_0 = 2 + \\sqrt{3}$. For this triple, we have $V = \\sqrt{3}$. We shall show this is the desired maximum. The proof will be based on the following lemma: Whenever $(x, y, t)$ and $(x, y', t')$ are valid triples with the same first component $x$, and $y' < y$, we have $t - x - y < t' - x - y'$. If this lemma is true, then, with respect to the symmetry, the similar conclusion holds for the valid triples $(x, y, t)$ and $(x', y, t')$ with the same second component $y$. Hence, any valid triple $(x, y, t)$ can be replaced by $(x, 1, t')$ and then by $(1, 1, t_0)$, and the value of $V$ increases or remains the same during this process, concluding $\\max V = \\sqrt{3}$. (Moreover, this also implies that $(1, 1, 2 + \\sqrt{3})$ is the only valid triple for which the maximum value $V = \\sqrt{3}$ is reached.)\n\nTo prove the lemma, notice that from\n\\[\nf(t) = f(x) + f(y), \\quad f(t') = f(x) + f(y'),\n\\]\nand from $f(y') < f(y)$ (which is implied by the given assumption $y' < y$), we have $f(x) < f(t') < f(t)$, hence $1 < t' < t$. Therefore $1 < t'y' < ty$, and from\n\\[\nf(x) = f(t) - f(y) = (t - y) \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{ty} \\right) = f(t') - f(y') = (t' - y') \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{t'y'} \\right),\n\\]\nusing the estimates\n\\[\n0 < 1 - \\frac{1}{t'y'} < 1 - \\frac{1}{ty},\n\\]\nwe obtain $t - y < t' - y'$, which is equivalent to the desired $t - x - y < t' - x - y'$.

For $j > 0$, take any proper prefix $w$ of $v_j$, let $w' = v_0v_1\\dots v_{j-1}w$, and let $a$ be the remainder of $\\sum v_0v_1\\dots v_{j-1}$ modulo $k$. Observe that $\\sum w' \\equiv a + \\sum w \\pmod k$. Therefore, the remainders realized by proper prefixes $w$ of $v_j$ are exactly the remainders realized by prefixes $w'$ as above with $a$ subtracted modulo $k$. Since between $i_j$ and $i_{j+1}$ there is no position at which a prefix of $u$ has sum congruent to $r$ modulo $k$, we infer that none of prefixes $w'$ as above has sum congruent to $r$ modulo $k$. This implies that $R(v_j) \\subseteq \\{q-a: q \\in R(u) \\setminus \\{r\\}\\}$, so $|R(v_j)| < |R(u)|$.\n\nNote that $\\sum v_j \\equiv 0 \\mod k$ for each $j = 1, 2, \\dots, p-1$ by construction. All these observations lead to the following three-turn strategy for Pepa:\n\n* Partition $u$ into $v_0$ and $v_1v_2 \\dots v_p$. If Geoff chooses $v_0$, then the rank of the word has already decreased. Otherwise Geoff chooses $v_1v_2 \\dots v_p$.\n* Partition $v_1v_2 \\dots v_p$ into $v_1v_2 \\dots v_{p-1}$ and $v_p$. If Geoff chooses $v_p$, then the rank of the word has already decreased. Otherwise Geoff chooses $v_1v_2 \\dots v_{p-1}$.\n* Partition $v_1v_2 \\dots v_{p-1}$ into $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_{p-1}$, which are all words with sums of numbers divisible by $k$. Regardless of the move of Geoff, the rank of the word chosen by him is strictly smaller than the rank of $u$.\n\nThis concludes the proof. \\(\\square\\)",

First, we prove that $I_A$ is the midpoint of the arc $EF$ of $\\omega$ that does not contain point $A$ (see the left figure).\n\nTo that end, note that since $I_A$ lies on the external angle bisector of $\\angle B$ and $BE = BD$, triangles $BEI_A$ and $BDI_A$ are congruent (SAS). Similarly, triangles $CFI_A$ and $CDI_A$ are congruent, so in particular $I_A E = I_A F$. Moreover, $\\angle BEI_A + \\angle CFI_A = \\angle BDI_A + \\angle CDI_A = 180^\\circ$, hence the points $A, E, I_A, F$ lie on a single circle in this order.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/2024CZPS_p3_data_b944ed5a1f.png)\n\nNext, we prove that $P$ is the second intersection of $I_A D$ and $\\omega$ (see the middle figure). Let $I$ be the incenter of triangle $ABC$. Then $ED \\parallel BI$ and $DF \\parallel IC$. Setting $\\angle EAF = \\alpha$, we get $\\angle EDF = \\angle BIC = 90^\\circ + \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha$, thus $\\angle EPF = \\alpha = \\angle EAF$, so $P$ lies on $\\omega$. Since $I_A$ is the midpoint of arc, it lies on the angle bisector $PD$, so $P$ lies both on $I_A D$ and on $\\omega$ as claimed.\n\nFinally, we show that $P$ lies on that arc of $\\omega$ which lies inside $\\Omega$ (see the right figure). Let $M \\neq A$ be the second intersection of $\\omega$ and $\\Omega$ (if they are tangent, we set $M = A$). Then $M$ is the center of the spiral similarity that maps $BE$ to $CF$ (alternatively, we angle- chase that triangles $MBE$ and $MCF$ are similar by AA). Thus $MB/MC = BE/CF = BD/DC$, so $MD$ is the angle bisector of $BMC$, and so it passes through the midpoint $S$ of the arc $BC$ of $\\Omega$ that does not contain $A$.\n\nNow forget about points $B, C, E, F$ and focus on circles $\\Omega, \\omega$ and on the points $A, M, I_A, S, D, P$. Circles $\\Omega$ and $\\omega$ share points $A$ and $M$. Being the A-excenter of $ABC$, point $I_A$ belongs to that arc $AM$ of $\\omega$ which lies outside of $\\Omega$ (e.g. since $AI_A > AS$). Point $S$ lies on the segment $AI_A$ and point $D$ lies on the segment $SM$, so point $D$ lies inside the angle $AI_A M$. Thus, point $P = I_A D \\cap \\omega$ belongs to the other arc $AM$ of $\\omega$ than $I_A$, namely to the one which lies inside $\\Omega$.",

For $\\alpha = 2$, the identity function $x \\mapsto x$ is another solution.\n\n*Solution-check.* The linear function clearly works. Consider the function $f$ such that $f(0) = 1$ and $f(x) = 0$ otherwise. Note that $yf(y) = 0$ for all real numbers $y$. Then it is sufficient to realize that $f(x^2 + y^2) \\neq 0$ iff $x = 0 \\land y = 0$. Similarly $f(x - y)f(x + y) \\neq 0$ iff $x + y = x - y = 0 \\Leftrightarrow x = 0 \\land y = 0$ which shows that also this function is a solution.\n\n*Proof.* Denote by $P(x, y)$ the proposition in the problem statement. Comparing $P(x, y)$ with $P(x, -y)$ yields $f(y) = -f(-y)$ for all $y \\neq 0$. Using this equality, $P(y, x)$ shows that $2f(x - y)f(x + y) = \\alpha(xf(x) - yf(y))$ for $x \\neq y$. Plugging this into the original equation, we obtain\n\n$$\nf(x^2 + y^2) = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}(xf(x) + yf(y))\n$$\n\nfor $x \\neq y$. Setting $y = 0$ in this equation shows $f(x^2) = \\alpha xf(x)/2$ for $x \\neq 0$, whereas $P(x, 0)$ gives $f(x^2) = f(x)^2$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Hence $\\alpha xf(x)/2 = f(x)^2$, that is, $f(x) = 0$ or $f(x) = \\alpha x/2$ for $x \\neq 0$. In particular, if $f(x) \\neq 0$, then $f(x) = \\alpha x/2$. On the other hand, $P(0, 0)$ shows $f(0) = f(0)^2$ and therefore $f(0) = 0$ or $f(0) = 1$.\n\nConsider first the case that $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \\neq 0$. Then both possible values for $f(0)$ yield functions fulfilling the original equation (if $(x, y) \\neq (0, 0)$, all terms in $P(x, y)$ are zero anyway and $(x, y) = (0, 0)$ was treated before).\n\nNow for the other case: There is a real number $z \\neq 0$ satisfying $f(z) = \\alpha z/2$. Then $f(z^2) = f(z)^2 = (\\alpha/2)^2 z^2 \\neq 0$, and hence $f(z^2) = (\\alpha/2)z^2$. By comparing the last two statements, we obtain $\\alpha = 2$ and then $f(z) = z$.\n\n* $f(0) = 1$. Consider $P(z/2, z/2): f(z^2/2) = z + zf(z/2)$. The left-hand side is 0 or $z^2/2$, the right-hand side $z$ or $z+z^2/2$. Since $z \\neq 0$, only $z^2/2 = z \\Leftrightarrow z = 2$ and $0 = z + z^2/2 \\Leftrightarrow z = -2$ are possible. Either way, $f(2) = 2$ and $f(-2) = -2$, because $f$ is odd. But then $f(4) = f(2^2) = f(2)^2 = 4$, which is impossible, because we just proved that $z = 2$ and $z = -2$ are the only real numbers with $f(z) = z$.\n\n* $f(0) = 0$. We show that $f(x) = 0$ for all positive reals $x$ if $f$ is not the identity function:\n\n(1) There are $0 < a < b$ with $f(a) = 0$, $f(b) = b$. Then $P(x, y)$ for $x = \\sqrt{b-a}$ and $y = \\sqrt{a}$ yields\n\n$$\n0 \\neq b = f(b) = f(x - y)f(x + y) + 2f(a) = f(x - y)f(x + y),\n$$\n\nhence $f(x - y) = x - y$ and $f(x + y) = x + y$ and $b = x^2 - y^2 = b - 2a$, forcing the contradiction $a = 0$.\n\n(2) There are $0 < a < b$ with $f(a) = a$, $f(b) = 0$. Analogous to Case 1, we arrive at the contradiction $b = 0$ when investigating $P(\\sqrt{b-a}, \\sqrt{a})$.\n\nExcept for the identity, we only have $f(x) = 0$ for $x > 0$ and thus $f(x) = 0$ for $x \\neq 0$ as possible solution, which we have already found and treated before.",

We claim further that Maryam can choose $r$ to be a perfect (integer) square. (Initially, $P(X, Y) = f(XY)$ with $f = T - 1$.) Maryam proceeds as follows:\n\n* If Artur multiplies with $X$, Maryam multiplies with $Y$ and if Artur multiplies with $Y$, Maryam multiplies with $X$. If initially, $P(X, Y) = f(XY)$ was on the board, then the resulting polynomial is $XYf(XY)$, so $f$ changes to $T \\cdot f$.\n* If Artur adds an integer $0 \\le a \\le 2025$, Maryam adds the number $-a \\le 2025$. The polynomial remains unchanged.\n* If Artur adds an integer $a < 0$, write $A(XY)$ for the new polynomial on the board, where $A \\in \\mathbb{Z}[T]$ is of the form (1). By the discussion above, $A$ has a unique positive real root $u$. As $A(x) > 0$ for all $x > u$, Maryam can choose an integer $c > u$ (e.g. $c = \\lfloor u \\rfloor + 1$) and add the negative integer $-A(c^2)$ to the polynomial $A$ on the board. Then the new polynomial on the board has again the form (1) and (by construction) $c^2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ as the only positive real root.\n\nHence, Maryam can always achieve that $Q$ (the polynomial in the end of the game) satisfies $Q = g(XY)$ where $g$ is of the form (1) and has a perfect square $s^2$, $s \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$, as unique positive real root. Now for all pairs of positive integers $(x, y)$, we have $Q(x, y) = 0 \\iff g(xy) = 0 \\iff xy = s^2$ and it is well known that the number of solutions $(x, y)$ to the last equation is (finite and) odd. (Pairs $(x, y)$ and $(y, x)$ with $x \\ne y$ correspond and $(s, s)$ is the only fixed point in this involution, giving an odd number overall.) Hence, Maryam can always win, independent of Artur's moves.",

Hence, for every pair of positive reals $c_1, c_2$ there are infinitely many $x$ such that $x > c_1$ and $f(x) > c_2$. Call this fact $(\\star)$.\n\nWe now multiply the given equation by $f(x + y + z)$, where $z$ is a positive real number, to get\n\n$$\nf(x + y + z)f(x + yf(x)) = f(x)f(x + y)f(x + y + z) = f(x)f(x + y + zf(x + y)),\n$$\n\nwhere we've used the property from the problem statement to obtain the second equality. We now choose $z$ such that $z > yf(x) - y$. Then $x + y + z > x + yf(x)$. Hence, we can apply the problem statement on both the left-most side and the right-most side of the above equation to get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} f(x + y + z)f(x + yf(x)) &= f(x + yf(x) + (z - yf(x) + y)f(x + yf(x))) \\\\ f(x)f(x + y + zf(x + y)) &= f(x + (y + zf(x + y))f(x)) \\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether with $f(x + yf(x)) = f(x)f(x + y)$, since the LHS's are equal in the above two equations, we get\n\n$$\nf(x + yf(x) + (z - yf(x) + y)f(x)f(x + y)) = f(x + (y + zf(x + y))f(x)). \\quad (3)\n$$\n\nIf the arguments in the above equation were equal, then by simplification, this would yield the equivalent equality\n\n$$\n(-yf(x) + y)f(x)f(x + y) = 0. \\quad (4)\n$$\n\nWe now choose $x_0, y_0$ such that $f(x_0) \\notin \\{0, 1\\}$ and $f(x_0 + y_0) \\neq 0$ and substitute $[x_0, y_0]$ into (2). Note that for this pair, equation (3) does not hold, and hence the arguments in (2) are always distinct. In particular, the arguments on both sides of (2) are linear functions in $z$ with the same positive gradient (namely $f(x_0) f(x_0 + y_0)$), but different $y$-intercept values. Since (2) holds for all large $z$ (namely all $z > y_0 f(x_0) - y_0$), it follows that $f$ is eventually periodic. Hence, there are constants $C, P > 0$ (dependent on $x_0, y_0$), such that $f(x) = f(x + P)$ for all $x > C$.\n\nBy $(\\star)$ we know that there is an $x_2 > C$ such that $f(x_2) \\notin \\{0, 1\\}$.

          "latex": "To simplify the formulations, we say that a point lies inside of the circle if it lies on that circle or in its interior. Assume we are given a circle $\\omega$ with the radius of $r$ and the centre $O$. A circle $\\omega'$ with the centre $O'$ contains the circle $\\omega$ if and only if its radius is at least $O'O + r$.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/cps_solutions_day2_p0_data_3417a17e81.png)\n\nDenote by $r_a$, $r_b$, $r_c$ the radii of our circles with the centres at $A$, $B$ and $C$, respectively. Using our observation three times indicates that the centre $X$ of the circle we are seeking has to meet $s \\ge AX + r_a$, or equivalently $AX \\le s - r_a$, and analogously $BX \\le s - r_b$ and $CX \\le s - r_c$.\n\nNotice that the numbers $s - r_a$, $s - r_b$ and $s - r_c$ are positive. We will show this for $s - r_a$. Since our circles are disjoint with disjoint interiors, we know that $r_a < b$ and $r_a < c$. This gives us $r_a < \\frac{b+c}{2} < \\frac{a+b+c}{2} = s$, which indeed means that $s - r_a$ is a positive number.\n\nNow we may consider three circles with the centres $A$, $B$ and $C$ and radii $s - r_a$, $s - r_b$ and $s - r_c$, respectively. If we prove that there is a point $X$ lying inside each of them, we will be done.\n\nEach two of these three circles intersect at two points, because for example $(s - r_a) + (s - r_b) > 2s - c = a + b > c$ (and also $c > |(s - r_a) - (s - r_b)|$). For the sake of contradiction assume there is no point lying inside all of them. Then the situation looks like on the picture, that is, there exists a point $X$ inside of the triangle which lies outside of the three circles (see the remark at the end):\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/cps_solutions_day2_p0_data_a6dcffc1dd.png)\n\nFor such $X$ we have $AX + BX + CX > s - r_a + s - r_b + s - r_c > 2s$. This is not possible, however. Let $Y$ be the intersection of $BX$ and $AC$. Then usign the triangle inequalities for the triangles $CXY$, $ABY$ we get\n\n$$\nBX + CX < BX + XY + CY = BY + CY < AB + AY + CY = AB + AC.\n$$\n\nSimilarly $AX + BX < AC + BC$ and $CX + AX < BC + AB$. Summing these three inequalities we obtain $AX + BX + CY < AB + BC + AC = 2s$, which is a contradiction.\n\n\\textbf{Remark.} If three circles $\\omega_a$, $\\omega_b$ and $\\omega_c$ with the centres $A$, $B$ and $C$, respectively, satisfy the conditions that each two of them intersect and there is no point lying inside all of the three circles, then there exists a point in the interior of the triangle $ABC$ which lies outside of each of the three circles.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/cps_solutions_day2_p1_data_b34ad8de82.png)\n\nTo prove this, consider the intersection point $P$ of $\\omega_b$ and $\\omega_c$ which lies in the halfplane determined by the line $BC$ and the point $A$. The intersection $Q$ of the ray $BA$ with $\\omega_b$ lies inside of $\\omega_a$, since it is the closest point of $\\omega_b$ to $A$ (this is true even if $A$ is inside of $\\omega_b$, since $\\omega_a \\cap \\omega_b \\neq \\emptyset$). Therefore $A$ cannot lie in the angle $CBP$ (otherwise $Q$ would lie inside all of the three circles). But that means $P$ lies in the interior of the angle $CBA$. Similarly $P$ lies in the interior of the angle $BCA$. So we have that $P$ lies in the interior of the triangle $ABC$. Since $P$ does not lie inside of $\\omega_a$, there is a point in the neighbourhood of $P$ lying outside of all the three circles.",

Now $\\gcd(tu, t^2 + u^2) = 1$. Therefore, (6) implies $tu | vw$.

In the case $p \\equiv -1 \\pmod 4$, i. e. when $-1$ is a quadratic non-residue mod $p$, this means that $p$ divides $v$ (and $t$ or $u$). But since the same argument is valid for $w$ instead of $v$, we have $p | v, w$ contradicting the coprimality of $v$ and $w$. Thus the infinitely many primes with $p \\equiv -1 \\pmod 4$ have no fantastic multiple and part (a) is solved.\n\nFor part (b) we choose $v = 1$ and substitute $w = tu$.

Therefore every prime factor of the Fibonacci number $F_{2l+3}$ has a fantastic multiple.\n\nIn view of the well-known formula $\\text{gcd}(F_a, F_b) = F_{\\text{gcd}(a,b)}$ it is clear that $F_a$ and $F_b$ are relatively prime, if $a$ and $b$ are different prime numbers. Hence we know that infinitely many prime numbers have a fantastic multiple, which solves part (b).\n\n\\textsuperscript{1}It is a well-known problem that $tu$ | $t^2 + u^2 + 1$ with $t > u$ is only possible if $t$ and $u$ are Fibonacci numbers of the form $t = F_{2l+1}$, $u = F_{2l-1}$ in which case $t^2 + u^2 + 1 = 3tu$.\n\n\\textsuperscript{2}This is a special case of Vajda's identity $F_{n+i}F_{n+j} - F_nF_{n+i+j} = (-1)^nF_iF_j$",
