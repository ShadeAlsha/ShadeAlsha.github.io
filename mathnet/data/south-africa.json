If $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ are the sizes of the bundles involved (the size of a bundle is the number of parallel lines it consists of), then we get\n\n$$\na_1a_2 + a_2a_3 + \\dots + a_{n-1}a_n \\text{ or } a_1a_2 + a_2a_3 + \\dots + a_{n-1}a_n + a_na_1\n$$\n\nintersections.

For $n > 5$, consider an index $k$ such that $a_{k-1} + a_{k+1}$ is maximal (indices modulo $n$). Without loss of generality, let this $k$ be 2.

Furthermore, one has\n\n$$\na_1a_2 \\le \\frac{(a_1 + a_2)^2}{4}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\na_1a_2 + a_2a_3 + a_3a_1 \\le \\frac{(a_1 + a_2 + a_3)^2}{3},\n$$\n\nagain applying the AM-GM-inequality. Hence a chain or cycle of bundles as described above that comprises $M$ lines in total will yield at most $\\frac{M^2}{3}$ intersections. If there are two or more such chains or cycles, the inequality\n\n$$\n\\frac{m_1^2 + m_2^2 + \\dots + m_r^2}{3} \\le \\frac{(m_1 + m_2 + \\dots + m_r)^2}{3}\n$$\n\nshows that the number of intersections at a particular angle $\\alpha$ is always at most $\\frac{M^2}{3}$, where $M$ is the total number of lines. So the number of lines has to satisfy\n\n$$\n\\frac{M^2}{3} > 2010\n$$\n\nor $M \\ge 78$. Indeed, one can obtain more than 2010 intersections (2028, to be precise), formed by three bundles containing 26 lines each that intersect each other at a 60\\degree angle.\n\nFor the second part, we try to find a solution similar to the one in (a) that yields exactly 2010 intersections. Considering three bundles intersecting at a 60\\degree angle, we have to solve the equation\n\n$$\na_1a_2 + a_2a_3 + a_3a_1 = 2010.\n$$\n\nNote first that at least two of the three parameters $a_1, a_2, a_3$ must be even for the left hand side to be even. On the other hand, $a_1, a_2, a_3$ cannot all be even, since the left hand side would be divisible by 4 in this case, which 2010 is not. So two of the three parameters have to be even, the remaining one odd. This shows that the sum $a_1 + a_2 + a_3$ has to be odd, so that we cannot find a solution with $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 78$. We therefore aim for a solution with $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 79$. Let us first estimate $a_1, a_2, a_3$. By the AM-GM inequality, we have\n\n$$\n2010 = a_1a_2 + a_2a_3 + a_3a_1 \\leq a_1(a_2 + a_3) + \\frac{1}{4}(a_2 + a_3)^2 = a_1(79 - a_1) + \\frac{1}{4}(79 - a_1)^2\n$$\n\nand thus\n\n$$\n0 \\geq 3a_1^2 - 158a_1 + 1799.\n$$\n\nThe roots of this polynomial are $\\frac{1}{3}(79 \\pm \\sqrt{844})$, so that\n\n$$\n16 < \\frac{1}{3}(79 - 30) < \\frac{1}{3}(79 - \\sqrt{844}) \\leq a_1 \\leq \\frac{1}{3}(79 + \\sqrt{844}) < \\frac{1}{3}(79 + 30) < 37.\n$$\n\nThe same inequality holds for $a_2$ and $a_3$.\n\nSuppose now that $a_1$ and $a_2$ are even while $a_3$ is odd. Then $a_1a_2$ is divisible by 4, so that we have to have\n\n$$\na_3(a_1 + a_2) \\equiv 2010 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}.\n$$\n\nThis shows that one of $a_1, a_2$ is divisible by 4 ($a_1$, say) while the other one is not. Write $a_1 = 4b_1$, $a_2 = 4b_2 + 2$ and $a_3 = 2b_3 + 1$. Then $5 \\leq b_1 \\leq 9$ and $4 \\leq b_2 \\leq 8$, which only leaves us with a couple of cases to check. If we plug $a_1 = 4b_1$, $a_2 = 4b_2 + 2$ and $a_3 = 79 - a_1 - a_2$ into the equation, we obtain\n\n$$\n77b_1 + 75b_2 = 4b_1^2 + 4b_1b_2 + 4b_2^2 + 464.\n$$\n\nModulo 4, this yields $b_1 \\equiv b_2 \\pmod{4}$. So we are left with six cases to check: $(b_1, b_2) \\in \\{(5, 5), (6, 6), (7, 7), (8, 4), (8, 8), (9, 5)\\}$. (9, 5) is indeed a solution: we find $a_1 = 36$, $a_2 = 22$ and $a_3 = 21$, which solves the problem with a total of 79 lines.\n\nLet us finally show that it is not possible to solve the problem with 78 lines (by the argument given in (a), less than 78 lines cannot be sufficient). If we have two separate groups of bundles such that bundles from different groups do not intersect at an angle $\\alpha$, then suppose that these two groups contain $m_1$ and $m_2$ lines respectively. The argument in (a) now shows that we can obtain at most\n\n$$\n\\frac{m_1^2 + m_2^2}{3} = \\frac{(m_1 + m_2)^2 + (m_1 - m_2)^2}{3} \\leq \\frac{78^2 + 76^2}{3} < 2010\n$$\n\nintersections of the desired type. If we only have one group that forms a chain or cycle as in (a), then we can only get at most\n\n$$\n\\frac{78^2}{4} < 2010\n$$",

Considering three bundles intersecting at a 60\\degree angle, we have to solve the equation\n\n$$\na_1a_2 + a_2a_3 + a_3a_1 = 2010.\n$$\n\nNote first that at least two of the three parameters $a_1, a_2, a_3$ must be even for the left hand side to be even. On the other hand, $a_1, a_2, a_3$ cannot all be even, since the left hand side would be divisible by 4 in this case, which 2010 is not. So two of the three parameters have to be even, the remaining one odd. This shows that the sum $a_1 + a_2 + a_3$ has to be odd, so that we cannot find a solution with $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 78$. We therefore aim for a solution with $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 79$. Let us first estimate $a_1, a_2, a_3$. By the AM-GM inequality, we have\n\n$$\n2010 = a_1a_2 + a_2a_3 + a_3a_1 \\leq a_1(a_2 + a_3) + \\frac{1}{4}(a_2 + a_3)^2 = a_1(79 - a_1) + \\frac{1}{4}(79 - a_1)^2\n$$\n\nand thus\n\n$$\n0 \\geq 3a_1^2 - 158a_1 + 1799.\n$$\n\nThe roots of this polynomial are $\\frac{1}{3}(79 \\pm \\sqrt{844})$, so that\n\n$$\n16 < \\frac{1}{3}(79 - 30) < \\frac{1}{3}(79 - \\sqrt{844}) \\leq a_1 \\leq \\frac{1}{3}(79 + \\sqrt{844}) < \\frac{1}{3}(79 + 30) < 37.\n$$\n\nThe same inequality holds for $a_2$ and $a_3$.\n\nSuppose now that $a_1$ and $a_2$ are even while $a_3$ is odd. Then $a_1a_2$ is divisible by 4, so that we have to have\n\n$$\na_3(a_1 + a_2) \\equiv 2010 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}.\n$$\n\nThis shows that one of $a_1, a_2$ is divisible by 4 (a_1, say) while the other one is not. Write $a_1 = 4b_1$, $a_2 = 4b_2 + 2$ and $a_3 = 2b_3 + 1$. Then $5 \\leq b_1 \\leq 9$ and $4 \\leq b_2 \\leq 8$, which only leaves us with a couple of cases to check. If we plug $a_1 = 4b_1$, $a_2 = 4b_2 + 2$ and $a_3 = 79 - a_1 - a_2$ into the equation, we obtain\n\n$$\n77b_1 + 75b_2 = 4b_1^2 + 4b_1b_2 + 4b_2^2 + 464.\n$$\n\nModulo 4, this yields $b_1 \\equiv b_2 \\pmod{4}$. So we are left with six cases to check: $(b_1, b_2) \\in \\{(5, 5), (6, 6), (7, 7), (8, 4), (8, 8), (9, 5)\\}$. (9, 5) is indeed a solution: we find $a_1 = 36$, $a_2 = 22$ and $a_3 = 21$, which solves the problem with a total of 79 lines.\n\nLet us finally show that it is not possible to solve the problem with 78 lines (by the argument given in (a), less than 78 lines cannot be sufficient). If we have two separate groups of bundles such that bundles from different groups do not intersect at an angle $\\alpha$, then suppose that these two groups contain $m_1$ and $m_2$ lines respectively. The argument in (a) now shows that we can obtain at most\n\n$$\n\\frac{m_1^2 + m_2^2}{3} = \\frac{(m_1 + m_2)^2 + (m_1 - m_2)^2}{3} \\leq \\frac{78^2 + 76^2}{3} < 2010\n$$\n\nintersections of the desired type. If we only have one group that forms a chain or cycle as in (a), then we can only get at most\n\n$$\n\\frac{78^2}{4} < 2010\n$$\n\nintersections, unless there are exactly three bundles that intersect at 60\\degree angles.

For $n > 5$, consider an index $k$ such that $a_{k-1} + a_{k+1}$ is maximal (indices modulo $n$). Without loss of generality, let this $k$ be 2. Then we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*} a_1a_2 + a_2a_3 + \\dots + a_{n-1}a_n + a_na_1 & \\\\ &= a_2(a_1 + a_3) + a_n(a_{n-1} + a_1) + a_3a_4 + \\dots + a_{n-2}a_{n-1} \\\\ &\\le (a_2 + a_n)(a_1 + a_3) + a_3a_4 + \\dots + a_{n-2}a_{n-1} \\\\ &\\le a_1(a_2 + a_n) + (a_2 + a_n)a_3 + a_3a_4 + \\dots + a_{n-2}a_{n-1} + a_{n-1}a_1 \\\\ &\\le \\frac{(a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_{n-1} + a_n)^2}{4} = \\frac{M^2}{4} \\end{align*}\n$$\n\nby the induction hypothesis. Furthermore, one has\n\n$$\na_1a_2 \\le \\frac{(a_1 + a_2)^2}{4}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\na_1a_2 + a_2a_3 + a_3a_1 \\le \\frac{(a_1 + a_2 + a_3)^2}{3},\n$$\n\nagain applying the AM-GM-inequality. Hence a chain or cycle of bundles as described above that comprises $M$ lines in total will yield at most $\\frac{M^2}{3}$ intersections. If there are two or more such chains or cycles, the inequality\n\n$$\n\\frac{m_1^2 + m_2^2 + \\dots + m_r^2}{3} \\le \\frac{(m_1 + m_2 + \\dots + m_r)^2}{3}\n$$\n\nshows that the number of intersections at a particular angle $\\alpha$ is always at most $\\frac{M^2}{3}$, where $M$ is the total number of lines. So the number of lines has to satisfy\n\n$$\n\\frac{M^2}{3} > 2010\n$$\n\nor $M \\ge 78$. Indeed, one can obtain more than 2010 intersections (2028, to be precise), formed by three bundles containing 26 lines each that intersect each other at a 60\\degree angle."

If n is even, then each of the rows and columns contains either n/2 1s and 3n/2 -1s, or vice versa, so that M = n.

If there is a row or column that contains as many 1s as -1s, then M = 0, and we are done. Otherwise, split the set of all 4n rows and columns into two subsets: those that contain more 1s than -1s, and those that contain more -1s than 1s. One of these two sets must contain at least 2n elements. Without loss of generality, assume that there are at least 2n rows and columns (of which k are rows and l columns) that contain more 1s than -1s.

The result again follows by induction.\n\nInspecting the first few terms, we see that $u_2 = 2011$ is prime. Let us show that there are no other primes. $u_0$ and $u_1$ are non-prime by inspection. For $n \\ge 1$, $u_{2n+1} = u_{n+1}^2 - u_n^2 = (u_{n+1} - u_n)(u_{n+1} + u_n)$. By the inequality above, both factors are at least 2 and so $u_{2n+1}$ is not prime. For $n > 1$, $u_{2n} = u_n(2u_{n+1} - 2011u_n)$. The first term is clearly greater than 1, and the second equals $u_{n+1} - u_{n-1} \\ge u_{n+1} - u_n \\ge 2$.\n\nThus, $u_2 = 2011$ is the only prime in the sequence.",

Also, $f(x)$ lies between $f(x-y)$ and $f(x+y)$, so for any $\\delta$ we can choose a $y$ such that $f(x) - \\delta < f(x-y) < f(x) < f(y) < f(x) + \\delta$.\n\nNow let $x = z + \\epsilon$ and $x = z - \\epsilon$.

Then two of the vertices, without loss of generality A and B, belong to the same set, say $S_1$. Then clearly C and D do not belong to $S_1$.\n\nSuppose that C and D are both elements of $S_2$. Consider edge AD. Since $a + \\frac{1}{8^2} = \\frac{65}{64}$, $S_1$ can only contain points on AD less than distance $\\frac{1}{8}$ from A, and similarly $S_2$ can only contain points on AD less than distance $\\frac{1}{8}$ from D, and so neither the midpoints of AD nor BC belongs to $S_1 \\cup S_2$. Hence both midpoints must belong to the set $S_3$, but a similar argument as above shows that $S_3$ can cover at most $2 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}$ units of segment AD. Since $2 \\times \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{8} < 1$, this configuration cannot cover ABCD. Hence we may suppose that $C \\in S_2$ and $D \\in S_3$.\n\nAs before, $S_1$ can only contain points at a distance less than $\\frac{1}{8}$ from A, $S_3$ must contain the rest of segment AD. In particular, if X is the point on AD such that $AX = \\frac{1}{8}$, then $X \\in S_1$. Let E be the midpoint of CD. By Pythagoras, the distance $EX = \\frac{65}{8}$, and hence E cannot belong to $S_3$. A similar argument shows that E cannot belong to $S_2$ either, and clearly E does not belong to $S_1$. Hence it is impossible to cover all of ABCD with sets of diameter less than $\\frac{\\sqrt{65}}{8}$.",

Choosing $a = 1$ we get $f(2) = 0$ or $f(2) = 4f(1)$.\n\nIf $f(2) = 0$, then $f$ is periodic with period 2 and we must have $f(n) = f(1)$ for all odd $n$. It is easy to verify that for each $c \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ the function\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\begin{cases} 0, & 2 \\mid n, \\\\ c, & 2 \\nmid n \\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nsatisfies the conditions of the problem.\n\nAssume now that $f(2) = 4f(1)$ and that $f(1) \\neq 0$. Assume that $f(i) = i^2 \\cdot f(1)$ holds for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$ (it certainly does for $i \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$). We place $a = 1$, $b = n$, $c = -n - 1$ in the original equation to obtain:\n\n\\[\nf(1)^2 + n^4 f(1)^2 + f(n+1)^2 = 2n^2 f(1)^2 + 2(n^2 + 1)f(n+1)f(1) \\\\ \\Leftrightarrow (f(n+1) - (n+1)^2 f(1)) \\cdot (f(n+1) - (n-1)^2 f(1)) = 0.\n\\]\n\nIf $f(n+1) = (n-1)^2 f(1)$ then setting $a = n+1$, $b = 1-n$, and $c = -2$ in the original equation yields\n\n\\[\n2(n - 1)^4 f(1)^2 + 16f(1)^2 = 2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2(n - 1)^2 f(1)^2 + 2 \\cdot (n - 1)^4 f(1)\n\\]\n\nwhich implies $(n-1)^2 = 1$ hence $n = 2$. Therefore $f(3) = f(1)$. Placing $a = 1$, $b = 3$, and $c = 4$ into the original equation implies that $f(4) = 0$ or $f(4) = 4f(1) = f(2)$. If $f(4) \\neq 0$ we get\n\n\\[\nf(2)^2 + f(2)^2 + f(4)^2 = 2f(2)^2 + 4f(2)f(4)\n\\]\n\nhence $f(4) = 4f(2)$. We already have that $f(4) = f(2)$ and this implies that $f(2) = 0$, which is impossible according to our assumption."

Clearly, there can be no more than $4 = 2+2$ coins on a $2 \\times 2$-board. So assume that the statement is true for all $m \\times n$-boards with $m, n > 1$ and $m+n < k$. Consider an $m \\times n$-board where $n+m=k$. Without loss of generality, we may assume that $m \\le n$. Consider an arrangement of $k+1$ coins on the board. We have $k+1 = m+n+1 \\ge 2m+1$. By the Pigeonhole Principle, we may now deduce that there exists some row with at least 3 coins. Of these coins, one of the middle ones already has two neighbours, so it is alone in a column. If this column is deleted, we remain with an $m \\times (n-1)$-board ($n-1 > 1$, since we had three or more coins in the row we selected) with $k = m+n$ coins on it, which contradicts our induction hypothesis.\n\nWe conclude that $m+n$ is indeed the maximum number of coins, which in our case gives us $20+13=33$."

If $a_1 = 0$, then $\\text{area}(OA_1B_k) = a_1b_k = 0$ for all $k$, which means that all $B_k$ lie on a straight line through $O$ and $A_1$. Likewise, if $b_1 = 0$, then all $A_j$ lie on a straight line through $O$ and $B_1$. So we can assume from now on that none of the areas is zero.\n\nSuppose there are two points among $A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_n$ that are not on the same line through $O$ (since the numbering does not matter, we can assume that $A_1$ and $A_2$ have this property), and at the same time there are two points (again, we can assume them to be $B_1$ and $B_2$) that are not on the same line through $O$. We have\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{area}(OA_1B_2)}{\\text{area}(OA_1B_1)} = \\frac{a_1b_2}{a_1b_1} = \\frac{b_2}{b_1} = \\frac{a_2b_2}{a_2b_1} = \\frac{\\text{area}(OA_2B_2)}{\\text{area}(OA_2B_1)}.\n$$\n\nSince triangles $OA_1B_1$ and $OA_1B_2$ have the same base ($OA_1$), their heights must be in a $b_1/b_2$-ratio. The same is true for the heights of triangles $OA_2B_1$ and $OA_2B_2$. If $B_1B_2$ is parallel to $OA_1$, then $b_1 = b_2$, so $B_1B_2$ is parallel to $OA_2$. In this case, $O, A_1$ and $A_2$ lie on one line, contradicting the assumption. The same argument applies if $B_1B_2$ is parallel to $OA_2$.\n\nIf neither $OA_1$ nor $OA_2$ is parallel to $B_1B_2$, let $X$ be the intersection of $OA_1$ and $B_1B_2$, and let $Y$ be the intersection of $OA_2$ and $B_1B_2$.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/s3s2014_p4_data_f5105720b1.png)\n\nSince $A_1$ and $A_2$ are in the first quadrant, $X$ and $Y$ are either in the first or third quadrant. In either case, they are not between $B_1$ and $B_2$. Using similar triangles, we see that the ratio of the heights of $OA_1B_1$ and $OA_1B_2$ is $|XB_1|/|XB_2|$, which must be $b_1/b_2$. The same is true (analogously) for the ratio $|YB_1|/|YB_2|$. Hence\n\n$$\n\\frac{|XB_1|}{|XB_2|} = \\frac{b_1}{b_2} = \\frac{|YB_1|}{|YB_2|}\n$$\n\nIf $X$ and $Y$ are on different sides of $B_1B_2$, one of these ratios is greater than 1, the other less than 1, a contradiction. Thus we assume that $B_1$ is closer to both $X$ and $Y$ (otherwise, we just interchange the roles of $B_1$ and $B_2$), as in the figure. We get\n\n$$\n1 - \\frac{|B_1B_2|}{|XB_2|} = \\frac{|XB_2| - |B_1B_2|}{|XB_2|} = \\frac{|YB_2| - |B_1B_2|}{|YB_2|} = 1 - \\frac{|B_1B_2|}{|YB_2|}\n$$\n\nand thus $|XB_2| = |YB_2|$. This means that $X$ and $Y$ coincide, so $X, Y, O, A_1, A_2$ lie on one line, and we get a contradiction to our assumption again. This completes the proof.",

The same is true for the heights of triangles $OA_2B_1$ and $OA_2B_2$. If $B_1B_2$ is parallel to $OA_1$, then $b_1 = b_2$, so $B_1B_2$ is parallel to $OA_2$. In this case, $O, A_1$ and $A_2$ lie on one line, contradicting the assumption. The same argument applies if $B_1B_2$ is parallel to $OA_2$.\n\nIf neither $OA_1$ nor $OA_2$ is parallel to $B_1B_2$, let $X$ be the intersection of $OA_1$ and $B_1B_2$, and let $Y$ be the intersection of $OA_2$ and $B_1B_2$.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/s3s2014_p4_data_f5105720b1.png)\n\nSince $A_1$ and $A_2$ are in the first quadrant, $X$ and $Y$ are either in the first or third quadrant. In either case, they are not between $B_1$ and $B_2$. Using similar triangles, we see that the ratio of the heights of $OA_1B_1$ and $OA_1B_2$ is $|XB_1|/|XB_2|$, which must be $b_1/b_2$. The same is true\n(analogously) for the ratio $|YB_1|/|YB_2|$. Hence\n\n$$\n\\frac{|XB_1|}{|XB_2|} = \\frac{b_1}{b_2} = \\frac{|YB_1|}{|YB_2|}\n$$\n\nIf $X$ and $Y$ are on different sides of $B_1B_2$, one of these ratios is greater than 1, the other less than 1, a contradiction. Thus we assume that $B_1$ is closer to both $X$ and $Y$ (otherwise, we just interchange the roles of $B_1$ and $B_2$), as in the figure. We get\n\n$$\n1 - \\frac{|B_1B_2|}{|XB_2|} = \\frac{|XB_2| - |B_1B_2|}{|XB_2|} = \\frac{|YB_2| - |B_1B_2|}{|YB_2|} = 1 - \\frac{|B_1B_2|}{|YB_2|}\n$$\n\nand thus $|XB_2| = |YB_2|$. This means that $X$ and $Y$ coincide, so $X, Y, O, A_1, A_2$ lie on one line, and we get a contradiction to our assumption again. This completes the proof."

This means that either A1 is covered and B1 and A2 are empty (impossible with $1 \\times 2$ tiles) or B1 is covered and A1, B2 and C1 are empty (again impossible). This means that this rectangle can contain at most 2 empty squares. A similar argument shows that all of the $2 \\times 3$ rectangles have maximum two empty squares. However, this means that to get 9 empty squares in total, all four rectangles must have exactly two empty squares, and in addition the central square must be empty. It follows that the white squares C2, B3, D3 and C4 must all be covered.\n\nNow, from part (b) we know that of the 9 empty squares, 5 must be black and 4 white. The only remaining white squares are A2, A4, B1, B5, D1, D5, E2, E4, of which four must be empty. None of the pairs (A2,B1), (A4,B5), (D1,E2) and (D5,E4) can be empty, since that would force the corner square also empty, a contradiction. Hence exactly one in each of the above mentioned pairs is empty, and hence the three black squares surrounding it must be covered. For the first white square, this forces three black squares to be covered, and for each of the remaining three white squares, at least two additional black squares are covered, leaving at most $13 - (3 + 2 + 2 + 2) = 4$ black squares empty, which contradicts the fact that 5 black squares must be empty.",

It follows that the average of the four numbers is $-a/2$ (since the average is $-a/2$ for each of the two pairs). Since we know that the solutions are four consecutive numbers, it follows that they are $-a/2 - 3/2, -a/2 - 1/2, -a/2 + 1/2, -a/2 + 3/2$. Thus we find that\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{a^2 - 4a + 4b} = 3 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sqrt{a^2 - 4a - 4b} = 1.\n$$\n\nIf we subtract the two resulting equations\n\n$$\na^2 - 4a + 4b = 9,\n$$\n\n$$\na^2 - 4a - 4b = 1,\n$$\n\nwe obtain $8b = 8$ and thus $b = 1$. It follows that $a^2 - 4a = 5$, which gives the two possibilities $a = -1$ (giving the four consecutive numbers $-1, 0, 1, 2$ as solutions) and $a = 5$ (giving the four consecutive numbers $-4, -3, -2, -1$ as solutions).\n\nIn conclusion, we either have $a = -1$ and $b = 1$ or $a = 5$ and $b = 1$.\n\nSolution 2: Suppose that the four consecutive numbers are $n - 1, n, n + 1, n + 2$. The parabola $y = x^2 + ax + a$ reaches its minimum at $x = -a/2$, and the line $x = -a/2$ is its axis of symmetry. The two pairs of solutions both have to have this axis of symmetry, and the solutions to the second equation have to lie closer to the minimum at $x = -a/2$. Thus the only possibility is that $n - 1$ and $n + 2$ are the solutions to the first equation, while $n$ and $n + 1$ are the solutions to the second equation. This gives us the equations\n\n$$\n(n - 1)^2 + a(n - 1) + a = b, \\quad (1)\n$$\n\n$$\nn^2 + an + a = -b, \\quad (2)\n$$\n\n$$\n(n + 1)^2 + a(n + 1) + a = -b. \\quad (3)\n$$\n\nSubtract (1) from (3) to obtain\n\n$$\n4n + 2a = -2b. \\quad (4)\n$$\n\nSubtract (2) from (3) to obtain\n\n$$\n2n + 1 + a = 0. \\quad (5)\n$$\n\nMultiply (5) by 2 and subtract from (4):\n\n$$\n-2 = -2b,\n$$\n\nso $b = 1$.

Moreover, $WX = WZ$, so the two triangles $AWZ$ and $BXW$ are congruent. Let $BW = AZ = x$, so that $BX = AW = 5 - x$. Pythagoras' theorem gives us\n\n$$\nx^2 + (5-x)^2 = 13,\n$$\n\nwhich simplifies to $x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$. The two solutions are $x = 2$ and $x = 3$, and by symmetry we can assume that $x = 2$. So $BX = 3$, $XC = 7$, $AZ = 2$ and $ZD = 8$. Now let $CY = y$, so that $YD = 5 - y$. Applying Pythagoras' theorem again (and making use of the fact that $XY = YZ$), we get\n\n$$\n7^2 + y^2 = 8^2 + (5-y)^2.\n$$\n\nThis simplifies to $10y = 40$, so $y = 4$.

If $P(x)$ is increasing for $x \\ge A$, then $P(A)$, $P(A + 1)$, $P(A + 2)$, ... are a strictly increasing sequence of integers, thus distinct. Moreover, from some point on these numbers are all greater than the maximum of $P(x)$ for $x \\le A$. Likewise, $P(B)$, $P(B - 1)$, $P(B - 2)$, ... are a strictly decreasing sequence of integers, and from some point on they are all less than the minimum of $P(x)$ for $x \\ge B$. This means that there cannot be infinitely many pairs $x, y$ with $x \\ne y$ such that $P(x) - P(y) = 0$. The same argument applies if $P(x)$ is decreasing for $x \\ge A$ and $x \\le B$.\n\nThus $P(x)$ must be a polynomial of even degree. Now there exist integers $A$ and $B$ such that $P(x)$ is increasing for $x \\ge A$ and decreasing for $x \\le B$, or vice versa. Thus there can only be infinitely many pairs $x, y$ with $x \\ne y$ such that $P(x) - P(y) = 0$ if one of the two $(x, y)$ is $\\ge A$ while the other is $\\le B$. We show that $x + y$ has to be constant for these solutions. Let the first terms of the polynomial be as follows:\n\n$$\nP(x) = ax^n + bx^{n-1} + \\dots\n$$\n\nAssume that $a$ is positive, for otherwise one can replace $P(x)$ by $-P(x)$. If $an(x+y) \\ge -2b+1$, then we have\n\n$$\nP(x) - P(y) \\ge P(x) - P\\left(\\frac{-2b+1}{an} - x\\right) = x^{n-1} + \\dots,\n$$\n\nwhere the dots stand for terms involving lower powers of $x$. For large enough $x$, this will be strictly positive, so $P(x) - P(y) \\ne 0$. Likewise, if $an(x + y) \\le -2b - 1$, then we have\n\n$$\nP(x) - P(y) \\le P(x) - P\\left(\\frac{-2b-1}{an} - x\\right) = -x^{n-1} + \\dots,\n$$\n\nwhich is negative for large enough $x$. Hence $P(x) - P(y) \\ne 0$ in this case as well. Thus there must be infinitely many solutions of $P(x) - P(y) = 0$ with $an(x + y) = -2b$. In this case,\n\n$$\nP(x) - P\\left(\\frac{-2b}{an} - x\\right)\n$$\n\nis a polynomial with infinitely many zeros, hence it is constant. Thus\n\n$$\nP(x) = P\\left(\\frac{-2b}{an} - x\\right)\n$$\n\nfor all $x$, which gives\n\n$$\nQ(x) = P\\left(\\frac{-b}{an} + x\\right) = P\\left(\\frac{-b}{an} - x\\right) = Q(-x)\n$$\nfor all $x$. It follows that the polynomial $Q(x)$ can only contain even powers of $x$, i.e. $Q(x) = R(x^2)$. This gives us the second set of solutions, consisting of a polynomial of the form $P(x) = R((x-c)^2)$, where $2c$ is an integer, and $d=0$.",

Next note that $a_{N+1} = \\frac{(N+1)^2+(N+1)}{2} - \\frac{N^2-N+2}{2} = 2N$ divides $a_N + (N+1) = 2N$. Finally, for $n > N+1$, we have $a_n = a_{n-1} + n$ as in the second case, so $a_n$ again divides $a_{n-1} + n$.\n\nNow we prove that these are the only such sequences. First, let $a_k$ be an element of the sequence such that $a_k \\ge k$ (if such an element exists). Recall that $a_k + k + 1$ has to be a multiple of $a_{k+1}$. However, since $a_{k+1} > a_k$, we have\n\n$$\n2a_{k+1} \\ge 2(a_k + 1) > 2a_k + 1 \\ge a_k + k + 1.\n$$\n\nSo the only possible multiple of $a_{k+1}$ that $a_k + k + 1$ could be is $1 \\cdot a_{k+1}$, and it follows that $a_{k+1} = a_k + k + 1$. But then $a_{k+1} \\ge k + k + 1 \\ge k + 1$, so we can repeat the argument with $k+1$ instead of $k$ to show that $a_{k+2} = a_{k+1} + k + 2$, etc. Generally, we get $a_{n+1} = a_n + n + 1$ for all $n \\ge k$.\n\nIf $a_1 \\ge 1$, then we can invoke this observation immediately: $a_{n+1} = a_n + n + 1$ for all $n \\ge 1$, so\n\n$$\na_n = a_{n-1} + n = a_{n-2} + (n-1) + n = \\dots = a_1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + (n-1) + n = \\frac{n^2+n}{2} + (a_1 - 1),\n$$\n\nwhich is exactly our second solution.\n\nSuppose finally that $a_1 = 0$, and let $N$ be the largest index for which $a_N = N - 1$; if there is no largest index, then $a_n = n - 1$ for all $n$, and we obtain the first solution. Next note that $a_{N+1}$ has to divide $a_N + N + 1 = 2N$. By our choice of $N$, we have $a_{N+1} \\ne N$, and since $a_{N+1} > a_N = N - 1$, the only possible value (the only divisor of $2N$) for $a_{N+1}$ is $2N$. But then $a_{N+1} = 2N \\ge N + 1$, and we can apply the same observation as before: $a_{m+1} = a_m + m + 1$ for all $m \\ge N$, thus\n\n$$\na_n = a_{n-1} + n = \\dots = a_N + (N+1) + (N+2) + \\dots + (N-1) + n = \\\\ = (N-1) + \\frac{n^2+n}{2} - \\frac{N^2+N}{2} = \\frac{n^2+n}{2} - \\frac{N^2-N+2}{2}\n$$\n\nfor all $n > N$, which is indeed the third solution.",

Hence $2x_k$ remains in the table until the end of the procedure.\n\nBy the same argument, if we choose $x_\\ell$ to be the largest power of 3 that occurs among the numbers $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$, then $3x_\\ell$ remains in the table at the end. Thus there are at least three numbers left at the end, namely $1, 2x_k, 3x_\\ell$.\n\n(b) We construct a sequence of sets $X_r$ in the following way: $X_0 = \\{1\\}$, and\n\n\\[\nX_{r+1} = X_r \\cup \\{2^{2^r}x : x \\in X_r\\} \\cup \\{3^{2^r}x : x \\in X_r\\}\n\\]\n\nfor all $r \\ge 0$. In words: $X_{r+1}$ consists of $X_r$, all elements of $X_r$ multiplied by $2^{2^r}$, and all elements of $X_r$ multiplied by $3^{2^r}$. We claim that the final table, if $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$ are chosen to be the elements of $X_r$, consists of the three numbers $1, 2^{2^r}$ and $3^{2^r}$. Clearly, this is true for $r = 0$: there is only one row, and the initial numbers 1, 2, 3 remain in the table.\n\nFor the induction step, suppose the statement is true for $X_r$; we prove it for $X_{r+1}$. By the induction hypothesis, we can perform the reduction procedure in such a way that the rows corresponding to $X_r$ are reduced to $1, 2^{2^r}$ and $3^{2^r}$. The rows corresponding to $\\{2^{2^r}x : x \\in X_r\\}$ can be reduced to $2^{2^r}, 2^{2^r} \\cdot 2^{2^r} = 2^{2^{r+1}}$ and $2^{2^r} \\cdot 3^{2^r} = 6^{2^r}$, and the rows corresponding to $\\{3^{2^r}x : x \\in X_r\\}$ can be reduced to $3^{2^r}, 3^{2^r} \\cdot 2^{2^r} = 6^{2^r}$ and $3^{2^r} \\cdot 3^{2^r} = 3^{2^{r+1}}$. Applying the reduction procedure three more times to $2^{2^r}, 3^{2^r}$ and $6^{2^r}$, we end up with the three numbers $1, 2^{2^{r+1}}$ and $3^{2^{r+1}}$. This completes the induction and thus the proof of the second part.",

This equation can be rewritten as $(X + Y - 1)(X^2 - XY + Y^2 + X + Y + 1) = 0$. Note that $X^2 - XY + Y^2 + X + Y + 1 = 0$ is only solvable in $\\mathbb{Z}$ if $X = Y = -1$ (otherwise the discriminant is negative when considered as a quadratic in $X$). So there are two options here:\n\n1. $f(k) = 1 - f(1-k) = 1 + f(k-1)$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Then it follows immediately by induction and the fact that $f$ is odd that $f(n) = n$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n2. There is some $k_0 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $f(k_0) = f(1-k_0) = -1$. Then $f(-k_0) = 1 = 1 - f(1+k_0)$ implies that $f(1+k_0) = 0$. Hence, by using $(a, b, c) = (1+k_0, 1-k_0, -1)$ in the functional equation, we get that $0 - 1 - 1 + 3f(2)(-1)(1) = 1$, so that $f(2) = -1$. Thus $k_0 = 2$ is the smallest positive value of $k_0$ with the property that $f(k_0) = -1 = f(1-k_0)$. We have therefore established the base case of the proof by induction that $(f(3k), f(3k+1), f(3k+2)) = (0, 1, -1)$ for all $k \\ge 0$. Assume now that this statement is true for some $k \\ge 0$. Then, from $f(-3k-2) = 1 = 1 - f(1+3k+2)$, we find that $f(3+3k) = f(3(k+1)) = 0$. Using $(a, b, c) = (3k, 1, 3)$ in the functional equation (and recalling that $f(3) = f(1+2) = f(1+k_0) = 0
