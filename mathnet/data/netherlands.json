Let $k$ be the number on the last card, and let the sums of the numbers of Thomas and Nils at that very moment be $a$ and $b$. Nils has two options. If he gives away the last card, the difference between the outcomes becomes $(a+k) - b$, and if he keeps the card, the difference becomes $a - (b+k)$. Nils is able to win, unless both numbers are divisible by 3. But in that case $(a+k-b) - (a-b-k) = 2k$ would also be divisible by 3. Because $k$ is not divisible by 3, the number $2k$ is also not divisible by 3 and hence Nils can win with certainty.\n\n(b) Nils can win. We distinguish three types of cards, depending on the number on the card: type 1 (the number has remainder 1 when dividing by 3), type 2 (the number has remainder 2 when dividing by 3), and type 3 (the number is divisible by 3). Because $2019 = 3 \\cdot 673$ and the card 2020 is of type 1, there are 674 cards of type 1, 673 cards of type 2, and 673 cards of type 3.\n\nIn order to win, Nils chooses a card of type 3 in his first turn (and gives it to Thomas). Then there are 674 cards of type 1 left, 673 of type 2, and 672 of type 3. In the next turns he responds to Thomas's move in the following way (as long as he is able to).\n\n(i) If Thomas chooses a card of type 1, then Nils chooses a card of type 2 and gives it to the same person that got Thomas's card.\n\n(ii) If Thomas chooses a card of type 2, then Nils chooses a card of type 1 and gives it to the same person that got Thomas's card.\n\n(iii) If Thomas chooses a card of type 3, then Nils does the same (and gives the card to Thomas).\n\nAs long as Nils keeps this up, the sum of each player's cards is divisible by 3 after his turn (because a number of type 1 and a number of type 2 add up to a number which is divisible by 3).\n\nBecause the number of cards of type 3 is always *even* after Nils's turn, Nils can always execute his planned move in case (iii). Because the number of cards of type 1 is always 1 greater than that of type 2 after Nils's turn, he can also always execute his planned move in case (ii). Only at the moment when all cards of type 2 are gone and Thomas takes the last card of type 1 (case (i)), Nils cannot execute his planned move. However, in that case Nils cannot lose anymore. Indeed, after Thomas's turn the sum of the cards of one player is still divisible by 3, but the sum of the cards of the other player is not divisible by 3 anymore. Because there are only cards of type 3 left now, this will stay the same until all cards are gone. At the end, the difference between the sums of both players is not divisible by 3 and Nils wins.",

          "latex": "The number of red squares must equal the total number of squares covered by the $n$ tiles, hence the tile are only put on top of red squares. Consider a colouring of the board and the corresponding *horizontal covering* by the tiles (where all tiles are places horizontally) and the *vertical covering*. We will deduce a number of properties for the colouring, and then count how many colourings there are. The tile whose size is $1 \\times k$ is called the *k-tile*.\n\nBecause the horizontal covering contains an $n$-tile, each column has at least one red square. In the vertical covering, each column must therefore contain at least one tile; because there are exactly $n$ tiles, this means that there must be exactly one tile in each column. In the same way, each row must contain exactly one tile in the horizontal covering. Now number the rows and columns depending on the number of the tile that has been put there: so row $i$ is the row containing the $i$-tile in the horizontal covering, and analogously for the columns.\n\nWe will now prove that the square in row $i$ and column $j$ (which will be called $(i, j)$) is red if and only if $i+j \\ge n+1$. We prove this using induction on $i$. In row 1, there is only one red square, so that must be in the column containing the $n$-tile in the vertical covering, i.e. column $n$. Hence, the square $(1, j)$ is red if and only if $j=n$, or if and only if $1+j \\ge n+1$. Now let $k \\ge 1$ and suppose the statement has been proved for all $i \\le k$. We want to prove the statement for $i=k+1$, i.e. that the square $(k+1, j)$ is red if and only if $k+1+j \\ge n+1$, or $j \\ge n-k$. Consider a column $j \\ge n-k$. Because of the induction hypothesis, we know exactly how many red squares this column has in rows 1, 2, ..., $k$: namely, the square $(i, j)$ is red if and only if $i+j \\ge n+1$, or $i \\ge n+1-j$; these are $k-(n-j) = j+k-n$ squares. In the other $n-k$ rows, this column needs another $j-(j+k-n) = n-k$ red squares. Hence, this column has a red square in each of these rows, in particular in the row $i=k+1$. In row $i=k+1$, the squares $(i, j)$ with $j \\ge n-k$ are all red, and these are $k+1$ squares. Hence, these are exactly all red squares in row $i=k+1$, hence the square $(i, j)$ is red if and only if $j \\ge n-k$, or if and only if $i+j \\ge n-k+k+1=n+1$. This finishes the proof by induction.\n\nNow consider two adjacent rows with row numbers $a$ and $b$, with $a > b$. In column $n-b$, there is a red square row $a$ (because $a+n-b > n$), but not in row $b$. In the row directly on the other side of row $b$ (if this row exists), there cannot be a red square in column $n-b$, because the red squares in column $n-b$ would otherwise not be consecutive, and then the tile with number $n-b$ cannot lie there. The row number of this row must therefore be smaller than $b$. We conclude that the row numbers cannot decrease first and then increase. Above and below row $n$, there must be a row with a smaller number (or no row at all), and the row numbers must descend in both directions from there. We see that the row numbers from top to bottom must first ascend until we get to row $n$, and then they must descend. The same can be proved for the column numbers.\n\nVice versa, we have to prove that if the row and column numbers are first ascending and then descending, then the horizontal and vertical tiles can be put. To prove this, we colour the square $(i, j)$ red if and only if $i+j \\ge n+1$. For a fixed $i$, the red squares are the squares $(i, j)$ with $j \\ge n+1-i$; because of the order of the column numbers, these columns are adjacent. Hence, in each row, the red squares are adjacent. The horizontal tiles can be put exactly on top of the red squares. In the same way, this can be done for the vertical tiles. For these row and column numbers, there was not other way to choose the colouring, because we already know that for each suitable colouring the square $(i, j)$ is red if and only if $i+j \\ge n+1$.\n\nAltogether, we are looking for the number of ways to choose the row",

After her turn the sheet contains the numbers $2m+3 = 2(m+1)+1$ and $996 - 2m = 998 - 2(m+1)$ ones.\n\n* If Ward picks $a = 2m + 1$ and $b = 1$, then the sheet contains the number $2m+2$ and $997 - 2m$ ones. Gabrielle then picks the two largest numbers, so $a = 2m + 2$ and $b = 1$ (which is allowed since their gcd is 1). Note that there is a one left, as $997 - 2m$ is odd, so not equal to 0. After her turn the sheet contains the numbers $2m + 3 = 2(m + 1) + 1$ and $996 - 2m = 998 - 2(m + 1)$ ones.\n\nThis completes the induction.\n\nTherefore Gabrielle can always make a move. After Gabrielle's turn 499 the only number left on the sheet is 999, so Ward can no longer make a move, and Gabrielle wins. \\u25a1",

Together, the angles of those six triangles add up to the same number of degrees as the eight angles of the octagon. Since the angles of any triangle add up to 180 degrees, this means that the eight angles of the octagon add up to $6 \\cdot 180^{\\circ} = 1080^{\\circ}$. Hence, each of the angles of the regular octagon is $\\frac{1}{8} \\cdot 1080^{\\circ} = 135^{\\circ}$.\n\nWe now consider the figure from the problem statement (see figure on the right). Line segment *BP* bisects angle *ABC*, so $\\angle ABP = \\angle PBC = 67\\frac{1}{2}^\\circ$. Since triangles *ABP* and *BCP* are isosceles (as $|AB| = |AP|$ and $|BC| = |CP|$), we also have $\\angle APB = \\angle BPC = 67\\frac{1}{2}^\\circ$ and $\\angle BAP = \\angle BCP = 180^\\circ - 135^\\circ = 45^\\circ$.\n\nIn triangles *ABQ* and *BCR* all sides have the same length. These triangles are therefore equilateral and all angles are 60\\textdegree. From this, we deduce that $\\angle PAQ = \\angle BAQ - \\angle BAP = 15^\\circ$. In the same way, we find $\\angle PCR = 15^\\circ$. Furthermore, triangles *PAQ* and *PCR* are isosceles (since $|AP| = |AQ|$ and $|CP| = |CR|$), so $\\angle APQ = \\angle BPC = 67\\frac{1}{2}^\\circ$ and $\\angle CPR = 82\\frac{1}{2}^\\circ$.\n\nBy mirror symmetry, *PQ* and *PR* have the same length, so *PQR* is an isosceles triangle with apex *P*. We have already determined all angles at *P*, except $\\angle QPR$. We deduce that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\angle QPR &= 360^\\circ - \\angle APQ - \\angle APB - \\angle BPC - \\angle CPR \\\\\n&= 360^\\circ - 2 \\cdot 67\\frac{1}{2}^\\circ - 2 \\cdot 82\\frac{1}{2}^\\circ = 60^\\circ.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFrom this and the fact that *PQR* is isosceles, we directly conclude that *PQR* is equilateral. $\\square$\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/NLD_ABooklet_2021_p14_data_b121870739.png)\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/NLD_ABooklet_2021_p14_data_ea995ecc41.png)",

Subtracting the third equation from the second, we obtain $y^2 - z^2 + x(y - z) = y - z$, or $(y - z)(y + z + x - 1) = 0$. This yields $y = z$ or $x + y + z = 1$.\n\nWe now distinguish two cases: $x = y$ and $x \\neq y$. In the first case, we have $y \\neq z$, as otherwise we would have $x = y = z$ for which the first equation becomes $0 = 1$, a contradiction. Now it follows that $x + y + z = 1$, or $2x + z = 1$. Substituting $y = x$ and $z = 1 - 2x$ in the first equation yields $x^2 - x(1 - 2x) = x - (1 - 2x) + 1$, which can be simplified to $3x^2 - x = 3x$, or $3x^2 = 4x$. We get $x = 0$ or $x = \\frac{4}{3}$. With $x = 0$, we find $y = 0$, $z = 1$, but does not satisfy our assumption $x \\ge y \\ge z$.

We verify that this is indeed a solution.\n\nNow consider the case $x \\neq y$. Then we have $x + y + z = -1$, hence we cannot have $x + y + z = 1$, and we see that $y = z$. Now $x + y + z = -1$ yields $x + 2z = -1$, hence $x = -1 - 2z$. Now the first equality becomes $(-1 - 2z)^2 - z^2 = 1$, which can be simplified to $3z^2 + 4z = 0$. From this, we conclude that $z = 0$ or $z = -\\frac{4}{3}$. With $z = 0$, we find $y = 0$, $x = -1$, which does not satisfy our assumption $x \\ge y \\ge z$.

Suppose that it is already possible with at most two times the number $p$. Each dot is lying on exactly three 'lines', hence there are at most six 'lines' containing a $p$. There are seven 'lines' in total, however, hence this is impossible. We conclude that she needs the number $p$ at least three times in total.\n\n(b) Denote the bottom three numbers from left to right by $a$, $b$, and $c$. Denote the number in the middle on the left side of the triangle by $d$. Now we can compute all numbers modulo $p$; note that all numbers are invertible modulo $p$ because $p$ itself does not appear, and $p$ is prime. The bottom line has product $abc$. The left side also needs to have this product, hence the top number in the triangle must be congruent to $abc(ad)^{-1} = bcd^{-1}$ modulo $p$. If we consider the line from the right bottom to the left middle, we see that the middle number must be congruent to $abc(cd)^{-1} = abd^{-1}$.

We see that $x_2 = x_3$ or $x_2 + x_3 + 1 + 6x_4 = 0$. Similarly, we also have either $x_2 = x_3$ or $x_2 + x_3 + 1 + 6x_1 = 0$. Hence, if $x_2 \\neq x_3$, the second equality must hold in both cases; subtracting one from the other, we obtain $x_1 = x_4$. We conclude that either $x_2 = x_3$ or $x_1 = x_4$. Analogously, we get for each permutation $(i, j, k, l)$ of $(1, 2, 3, 4)$ that either $x_i = x_j$ or $x_k = x_l$.\n\nWe will prove that at least three of the $x_i$ must be equal. If all four are equal, this is true of course. Otherwise, there are two unequal ones, say $x_1 \\neq x_2$ without loss of generality. Then we have $x_3 = x_4$. If also $x_1 = x_3$ holds, then there are three equal elements. Otherwise, we have $x_1 \\neq x_3$, hence $x_2 = x_4$ and we also get three equal elements. Up to order, the quadruple $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)$ is thus equal to a quadruple of the shape $(x, x, x, y)$, where we could have that $x = y$.\n\nSubstituting this in the equations gives $x+y = 8x^2$ and $2x = x^2 + y^2 + 6xy$. Adding these two equations: $3x + y = 9x^2 + y^2 + 6xy$. The right hand side can be factored as $(3x + y)^2$. Defining $s = 3x + y$, the equation becomes $s = s^2$, from which we get either $s = 0$ or $s = 1$. We have $s = 3x + y = 2x + (x + y) = 2x + 8x^2$.

If \\emph{m} is even, then we pair the squares of the board as follows: in every column we pair the top two squares, then squares 3 and 4, etc. As the number of rows is even, this pairs the squares of every column completely. Sting can use the following strategy: whenever Prickle places a pawn into one of a pair of squares, Sting places a pawn into the other, which is necessary adjacent to the pawn that Prickle just placed. After each move of Sting, all pairs contain either zero or two pawns, so Sting can always place a pawn according to this strategy. Therefore Sting can make sure that the entire board is eventually completely filled with pawns, so Sting wins. Analogously, if \\emph{n} is even, then Sting has a similar winning strategy.\n\nIf $m = n = 1$, Sting wins after Prickle's first move. If $m = 1$ and $n = 3$ (or the other way around), Sting can place his first pawn on a square adjacent to the square in which Prickle has just placed his; such an adjacent (empty) square always exists. The board will then be completely filled after Prickle's next move, so Sting has a winning strategy in these cases as well.\n\nNow consider the case $m = n = 3$. Prickle can follow the following strategy. He places his first pawn in the centre square. Sting must place his pawn either in the same row or in the same column. Without loss of generality, we assume that Sting's pawn is placed in the same column as that of Prickle. Prickle then places a pawn in the remaining square in the middle column. At that point, the left and right columns are completely empty. Sting must place his pawn into one of these columns. Prickle then chooses any square in the other column, all three squares of which are still empty. This forces Sting to place a pawn in that column as well, as the middle column was already completely filled. Now Prickle places a pawn in the only remaining square of that column, after which Sting can no longer place a pawn, while there are two empty squares remaining. Therefore Prickle has a winning strategy if $m = n = 3$.\n\nThe remaining case is that \\emph{m} and \\emph{n} are both odd, and that at least one of \\emph{m} and \\emph{n} is at least 5. We consider the case that \\emph{n} (the number of columns) is at least 5; the other case is analogous. Prickle can follow the following strategy. Prickle places his pawns into the centre column until it is completely filled with pawns. When it is Prickle's turn again, there is an even number of pawns on the board, all in the three columns in the centre of the board, of which at least the middle one is completely filled. The first and the last column are completely empty. As there is an odd number of squares remaining, either the area to the left of the middle column has an odd number of empty squares remaining, or the area to the right has. Prickle chooses the area which contains an odd number of empty squares, and places his pawns there until that area is full. As the centre column is",

Colour the vertical domino tiles in the odd numbered columns red and the vertical domino tiles in the even numbered columns blue. As in every row, every horizontal domino tile covers a square in an even numbered column and one in an odd numbered column, every row contains one more square covered by a red domino tile than squares covered by a blue domino tile. Now colour the horizontal domino tile in each row alternatingly blue and red (starting with blue). If the number of horizontal domino tiles is even, then at the end, the number of red squares will be one more than that of blue squares; if the number of horizontal domino tiles is odd, then at the end, the number of blue squares will be one more than that of red squares. The difference will therefore always be equal to 1.\n\nNow suppose that $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$. Then we have $V \\ge 2$ if Jetze places every domino tile horizontally; then every row contains an odd number of horizontal domino tiles. We show that $V = 2$ is always possible. Use the same strategy as in the odd case. After colouring the vertical domino tiles, the numbers of red and blue squares are equal. If we alternatingly colour the horizontal domino tiles in each row blue and red again, we see that in the end, in every row the difference between the number of red and blue squares is 0 or 2.\n\nFinally, suppose that $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$. We show that $V = 0$ is always possible. Number the rows from top to bottom from 1 up to $m$, and let $b_i$ be the number of vertical domino tiles of which the top square is in row $i$. By induction on $i$, we easily show that $b_i$ is even, using the fact that a horizontal domino tile always covers an even number of squares in a row. We now colour the vertical domino tiles in rows $i$ and $i+1$ as follows: if $b_i \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$, we colour half of them red, and the other half blue, and if $b_i \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$ we colour two more domino tiles red than we colour blue if $i$ is even, and we colour two more domino tiles blue than we colour red if $i$ is odd. We show that we can now colour the horizontal domino tiles in each row $k$ in such a way that every row has the same number of red and blue squares. If $b_{k-1} \\equiv b_k \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$, then vertical domino tiles in row $k$ cover the same number of red squares as blue squares. Moreover, the number of horizontal domino tiles in row $k$ is even, so we can simply colour half of them red and half of them blue. If $b_{k-1} \\equiv b_k \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$, then vertical domino tiles in row $k$ again cover the same number of red squares as blue squares, since of $k-1$ and $k$, one is odd and one is even. Again, the number of horizontal domino tiles in row $k$ is even, so we can again simply colour half of them red and half of them blue. If $b_{k-1} \\not\\equiv b_k \\pmod 4$, then the difference in the number of squares covered by red vertical domino tiles and blue vertical ones is equal to 2. The number of horizontal domino tiles is odd, so we can colour those in such a way that in the end, the number of red and blue squares are equal.\n\nHence the minimal values for $V$ are: $V = 1$ if $n$ is odd, $V = 2$ if $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$, and $V = 0$ if $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$. $\\square$\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/NLD_ABooklet_2021_p39_data_012780ddad.png)",

Colour the vertical domino tiles in the odd numbered columns red and the vertical domino tiles in the even numbered columns blue. As in every row, every horizontal domino tile covers a square in an even numbered column and one in an odd numbered column, every row contains one more square covered by a red domino tile than squares covered by a blue domino tile. Now colour the horizontal domino tile in each row alternatingly blue and red (starting with blue). If the number of horizontal domino tiles is even, then at the end, the number of red squares will be one more than that of blue squares; if the number of horizontal domino tiles is odd, then at the end, the number of blue squares will be one more than that of red squares. The difference will therefore always be equal to 1.\n\nNow suppose that $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$. Then we have $V \\ge 2$ if Jetze places every domino tile horizontally; then every row contains an odd number of horizontal domino tiles. We show that $V = 2$ is always possible. Use the same strategy as in the odd case. After colouring the vertical domino tiles, the numbers of red and blue squares are equal. If we alternatingly colour the horizontal domino tiles in each row blue and red again, we see that in the end, in every row the difference between the number of red and blue squares is 0 or 2.\n\nFinally, suppose that $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$. We show that $V = 0$ is always possible. Number the rows from top to bottom from 1 up to $m$, and let $b_i$ be the number of vertical domino tiles of which the top square is in row $i$. By induction on $i$, we easily show that $b_i$ is even, using the fact that a horizontal domino tile always covers an even number of squares in a row. We now colour the vertical domino tiles in rows $i$ and $i+1$ as follows: if $b_i \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$, we colour half of them red, and the other half blue, and if $b_i \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$ we colour two more domino tiles red than we colour blue if $i$ is even, and we colour two more domino tiles blue than we colour red if $i$ is odd. We show that we can now colour the horizontal domino tiles in each row $k$ in such a way that every row has the same number of red and blue squares. If $b_{k-1} \\equiv b_k \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$, then vertical domino tiles in row $k$ cover the same number of red squares as blue squares. Moreover, the number of horizontal domino tiles in row $k$ is even, so we can simply colour half of them red and half of them blue. If $b_{k-1} \\equiv b_k \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$, then vertical domino tiles in row $k$ again cover the same number of red squares as blue squares, since of $k-1$ and $k$, one is odd and one is even. Again, the number of horizontal domino tiles in row $k$ is even, so we can again simply colour half of them red and half of them blue. If $b_{k-1} \\not\\equiv b_k \\pmod 4$, then the difference in the number of squares covered by red vertical domino tiles and blue vertical ones is equal to 2. The number of horizontal domino tiles is odd, so we can colour those in such a way that in the end, the number of red and blue squares are equal.\n\nHence the minimal values for $V$ are: $V = 1$ if $n$ is odd, $V = 2$ if $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$, and $V = 0$ if $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$. $\\square$",

As neither 4 and -1 are prime numbers, there are no solutions $(p, q)$ with $p = q$.\n\nHence $p \\neq q$, so from the equation, it follows that $p \\mid 2q+3$ and $q \\mid p^2-p-1$. As $2q+3$ and $p^2-p-1$ are positive, it follows that $p \\leq 2q+3$ and $q \\leq p^2-p-1$. To find a better lower bound for $p$, we multiply these relations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\npq \\mid & (2q + 3)(p^2 - p - 1) \\\\\n& 2qp^2 - 2qp - 2q + 3(p^2 - p - 1) \\\\\n& 3(p^2 - p - 1) - 2q.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNote that $3(p^2 - p - 1) - 2q \\geq 3q - 2q = q > 0$.

This implies that $p = 2q + 3 = 2(p^2 - p - 1) + 3 = 2p^2 - 2p + 1$. This in turn implies that $(2p - 1)(p - 1) = 0$, but this equation does not have prime solutions.\n\n* Note that $k = 2$ and $k = 4$ are not possible either, since then $kp$ would be even, while $2q + 3$ is odd.\n\n* If $k = 3$, then it follows from $2q + 3 = 3p$ that $3 \\mid q$, and therefore that $q = 3$. Hence $p = \\frac{2q+3}{3} = 3$. However, this does not give a solution of the given equation.\n\nTherefore $k = 5$. Then we have $5p = 2q + 3$, and therefore $5q = p^2 - p - 1$ as well. Substituting this gives $25p = 5(2q + 3) = 2(p^2 - p - 1) + 15 = 2p^2 - 2p + 13$, and therefore $(p - 13)(2p - 1) = 0$. As $p$ is prime, it follows that $p = 13$, and that $q = \\frac{5p-3}{2} = 31$.

So if $n$ is prime or a power of 2, $n$ does indeed satisfy the given condition.\n\nFinally, suppose that $n$ is neither a prime number, nor a power of 2. Then we can write $n = de$ with $e \\ne 1$ odd (since $n$ is not a power of 2) and $d \\ne 1$ (since $n$ is not a prime number). As $(-1)^e - 1 = -2$, it follows from the computation above that $a^d + 2^d \\mid 2^{n+1}$. Hence $a^d + 2^d$ is a power of 2, so $a^d = 2^k - 2^d$ for some $d < k \\le n+1$. Therefore $a$ is divisible by 2 and $(\\frac{a}{2})^d = 2^{k-d} - 1$.\n\nNow we distinguish between the cases in which $d$ is even and in which $d$ is odd. In the first case $2^{k-d} - 1$ is a square. As $a > 2$, from $(\\frac{a}{2})^d = 2^{k-d} - 1$ it however follows that $k - d \\ge 2$, so this square is $-1 \\pmod 4$, which is a contradiction. If $d$ is odd, then we note that\n\n$$\n2^{k-d} = (\\frac{a}{2})^d + 1 = (\\frac{a}{2} + 1)((\\frac{a}{2})^{d-1} - (\\frac{a}{2})^{d-2} + \\dots + 1).\n$$\n\nAs $d \\ne 1$, we have $\\frac{a}{2} + 1 < (\\frac{a}{2})^d + 1$. The second factor in the product above is a sum of an even number of terms with the same parity as $\\frac{a}{2}$ and a term 1, so this factor is odd. As this second factor is also greater than 1, this contradicts it being a factor of a power of 2. $\\square$",

The total number of integers on the two pieces of paper is $a + b$, the number of integers on Alicia's piece of paper plus the number of integers on Britt's piece of paper. This, however, also equals $v+d$: the total number of distinct integers, plus the total number of integers that have been written down twice. Hence, we get that $a + b = v + d$.\n\n(a) We choose $a = b = 2022$ and look for a solution to $a \\cdot b = d \\cdot (v+d)$. We use the fact that $a+b=v+d$. This means that we are looking for solutions to $a \\cdot b = d \\cdot (a+b)$. If we substitute $a = b = 2022$, then we find that $2022 \\cdot 2022 = d(2022 + 2022) = d \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2022$, so $d = 1011$. Together with $a+b=v+d$, we find that $2022 + 2022 = v + 1011$, so $v = 3033$. This situation happens for example if Alicia writes down the numbers 1 to 2022, and Britt writes down the numbers 1012 to 3033. $\\square$\n\n(b) With a little bit of trying, and by choosing $d$ not too large, we find that $a = b = 3$, $d = 1$, and $v = 5$ is a solution: $3 \\cdot 3 = 1 \\cdot (5 + 4)$. The numbers also satisfy the equation $a + b = v + d$. This situation can occur if Alicia writes down the numbers 1, 2, and 3, and Britt writes down the numbers 3, 4, and 5, for example. $\\square$\n\n(c) Suppose that there are numbers such that $a \\cdot b = v \\cdot d$. We already deduced that $a+b=v+d$, or $v = a+b-d$. Substituting this yields\n$$ab = vd = (a+b-d)d = ad + bd - d^2.$$\n\nIf we now subtract $ad$ from both sides of this equation, we find $ab - ad = bd - d^2$, so $a(b - d) = d(b - d)$. Because Britt wrote down at least one number that Alicia did not write down, we have $b > d$. Therefore, we can divide the equation $a(b - d) = d(b - d)$ by the positive number $b - d$, and we find that $a = d$. On the other hand, Alicia wrote down at least one number that Britt did not write down, hence $a > d$. This gives a contradiction and hence there cannot exist numbers such that $a \\cdot b = v \\cdot d$. $\\square$",

The odd divisors 1 and 3 can occur, because the integer 3 itself is divisor primary.\n\nBecause of the unique factorisation in primes, the integer $n$ can now only have some factors 2 and at most one factor 3.

First we will show that the smallest possible integral average of a centenary set is 14, and then we will show that we can obtain all integers greater than or equal to 14, but smaller than 100, as the average of a centenary set.\n\nIf you decrease one of the numbers (unequal to 100) in a centenary set, the average becomes smaller. Also if you add a number that is smaller than the current average, the average becomes smaller. To find the centenary set with the smallest possible average, we can start with 1, 100 and keep adjoining numbers that are as small as possible, until the next number that we would add is greater than the current average. In this way, we find the set with the numbers 1 to 13 and 100 with average $\\frac{1}{14} \\cdot (1+2+\\dots+13+100) = \\frac{191}{14} = 13\\frac{9}{14}$. Adding 14 would increase the average, and removing 13 (or more numbers) would increase the average as well. We conclude that the average of a centenary set must be at least 14 when it is required to be an integer.\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer which could be the average of a centenary set is 14, which could for example be realised using the following centenary set:\n\n$$\n\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 18, 100\\}.\n$$\n\nNow we still have to show that all integers greater than 14 (and smaller than 100) can indeed be the average of a centenary set. We start with the centenary set above with average 14. Each time you add 14 to one of the numbers in this centenary set, the average increases by 1. Apply this addition from right to left, first adding 14 to 18 (the average becoming 15), then adding 14 to 12 (the average becoming 16), then adding 14 to 11, etcetera. Then you end up with the centenary set:\n\n$$\n\\{15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 32, 100\\}\n$$\n\nwith average 27, and you realised all values from 14 to 27 as an average. Because we started adding 14 to the second largest number in the set, this sequence of numbers remains increasing during the whole process, and therefore consists of 14 distinct numbers the whole time, and hence the numbers indeed form a centenary set.\n\nWe can continue this process by first adding 14 to 32, then 14 to 26 etcetera, and then we get a centenary set whose average is 40. Repeating this one more time, we finally end up with the set:\n\n$$\n\\{43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 60, 100\\}\n$$\n\nwith average 53. Moreover, we can obtain 54 as the average of the centenary set $\\{8, 100\\}$, 55 as the average of $\\{10, 100\\}$, and so on until 99, which we obtain as the average of $\\{98, 100\\}$. This shows that all values from 14 to 99 can be obtained. $\\square$",

We claim that for $n \\ge 11$, $f(n)$ is strictly increasing as a function of $n$. Therefore there is only a finite number of pairs as in the problem.\n\nWe view a way of taking a test as a subset of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$ by taking the set of numbers of questions that are answered correctly. We say that a subset $S_n$ of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$ is an $n$-equally correct set if the sum of all elements of $S_n$ is equal to the number of elements in the complement of $S_n$ in $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$. So by definition, $f(n)$ is the number of $n$-equally correct sets. Note that a subset $S_n$ of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$ is $n$-equally correct if and only if the sum of all elements of $S_n$ plus the number of elements of $S_n$ equals $n$.\n\nWe first claim that $f(n)$ is non-decreasing for $n \\ge 1$. Let $S_{n-1}$ be an $(n-1)$-equally correct set. Then adding 1 to the largest element of $S_{n-1}$ gets us a subset $S_n$ of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$. This subset has as many elements as $S_{n-1}$ and has sum 1 higher than the sum of $S_{n-1}$, which is therefore an $n$-equally correct set. This procedure defines an injective map $F_n$ from the set of $(n-1)$-equally correct sets to the set of $n$-equally correct sets for all $n \\ge 2$. Therefore $f(n) \\ge f(n-1)$ for all $n \\ge 2$.\n\nWe now show that, for $n \\ge 11$, there exists an $n$-equally correct set that is not in the image of $F_n$. Note that an $n$-equally correct set of which the two largest elements differ by exactly 1 cannot be in the image of $F_n$; the reason is that a set in this image is one that is obtained by adding 1 to the largest element of a subset of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n-1\\}$. If $n = 2k + 1$ with $k \\ge 5$, then $S = \\{1, k-2, k-1\\}$ is $n$-equally correct, as $1 + (k-2) + (k-1) + |S| = 2k + 1 = n$. Similarly, if $n = 2k$ with $k \\ge 6$, then $S = \\{2, k-3, k-2\\}$ is $n$-equally correct, because $2 + (k-3) + (k-2) + |S| = 2k = n$.

Everyone then moves up a chair every clap and for everyone, the first time they return to the chair they started on is after $n$ claps. So after $n$ claps for the first time, everyone has returned to the chair they started on. Now suppose $m < n$.\n\nSince $m$ is not a prime power, we can write $m$ as $m = k\\ell$ with $\\gcd(k, \\ell) = 1$. We claim that there are $a, b > 0$ such that\n\n$$\nak + b\\ell = n.\n$$\n\nNote that the numbers $n-ak$ with $a \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, \\ell\\}$ are all different modulo $\\ell$. We show this by contraposition. Suppose that there are $a_1$ and $a_2$ in $\\{1, 2, \\dots, \\ell\\}$ such that $n - a_1k \\equiv n - a_2k \\pmod \\ell$. Then we also have $(a_1 - a_2)k \\equiv 0 \\pmod \\ell$. As $\\gcd(k, \\ell) = 1$, it follows that $\\ell \\mid (a_1 - a_2)$. Since $a_1$ and $a_2$ both are in $\\{1, 2, \\dots, \\ell\\}$, it follows that $a_1 = a_2$. Therefore if $a_1$ and $a_2$ are in $\\{1, 2, \\dots, \\ell\\}$ and $a_1 \\ne a_2$, then $n - a_1k \\not\\equiv n - a_2k \\pmod \\ell$. So the numbers $n-ak$ with $a \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, \\ell\\}$ are indeed all different modulo $\\ell$.\n\nIt follows that the $n-ak$ for $a \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, \\ell\\}$ are all the $\\ell$ residue classes modulo $\\ell$. Since $n-ak \\ge n-\\ell k = n-m > 0$, these $\\ell$ numbers are also\nall greater than 0. Now choose the $a$ for which $n - ak$ is congruent to 0 modulo $l$. Since $n - ak$ is greater than 0, there is now a $b > 0$ such that $n - ak = bl$. This gives the $a, b > 0$ such that $ak + bl = n$.\n\nNow we divide the chairs into $a$ groups of $k$ chairs and $b$ groups of $l$ chairs. In each group, we arrange the chairs in a circle and attach the leaves to chairs in such a way that each leaf has the number of the next chair in the circle. The players on a chair in a group with $k$ chairs, return to the chair they started on every $k$ claps (and not on any other clap). The players on a seat in a group with $l$ seats, return to the chair they started on every $l$ claps (and not on any other clap). So the first time everyone returns to the chair they started on is after $\\text{lcm}(k, l)$ claps. But\n\n$$\n\\text{lcm}(k, l) = k\\ell = m,\n$$\n\nbecause $\\text{gcd}(k, l) = 1$. $\\square$"

          "latex": "We proceed by induction on $n$. For $n=1$, the only number in the sequence is $1^1$, so the given statement is trivially true.\n\nFor the induction step, we are to show that for $n \\ge 1$, the numbers $1^1, 3^3, 5^5, \\dots, (2^{n+1}-1)2^{n+1-1}$ are in different residue classes modulo $2^{n+1}$, given the induction hypothesis that $1^1, 3^3, 5^5, \\dots, (2^n-1)2^{n-1}$ are in different residue classes modulo $2^n$.\n\nSo suppose that that is the case. We split the numbers $1^1, 3^3, 5^5, \\dots, (2^{n+1}-1)2^{n+1-1}$ into two groups, namely $1^1, 3^3, 5^5, \\dots, (2^n-1)2^{n-1}$, which we will call the *lesser group*, and $(2^n+1)2^{n+1}, (2^n+3)2^{n+3}, \\dots, (2^{n+1}-1)2^{n+1-1}$, which we will call the *greater group*. First note that the numbers in the lesser group are also all in different residue classes modulo $2^{n+1}$.\n\nNote that because $\\varphi(2^{n+1}) = 2^n$, we have $a^k \\equiv a^\\ell \\pmod{2^{n+1}}$ for $k, \\ell, a$ such that $k \\equiv \\ell \\pmod{2^n}$ and $a$ is odd. We will use this observation to compare the residue classes of the greater group to those of the lesser group.\n\nWrite the numbers in the greater group as $(2^n+m)2^{n+m}$ for $1 \\le m \\le 2^n-1$ and odd. Expanding $(2^n+m)2^{n+m}$ using Newton's binomial, we note that any term with at least two factors $2^n$ is congruent to 0 modulo $2^{n+1}$. We thus find modulo $2^{n+1}$ that\n\n$$\n\\begin{align} \n(2^n + m)2^{n+m} &\\equiv m2^{n+m} + (2^n + m)m2^{n+m-1}2^n + 2^{2n}(\\cdots) \\notag \\\\\n&\\equiv m2^{n+m} + (2^n + m)m2^{n+m-1}2^n \\notag \\\\\n&\\equiv m^m + (2^{2n} + 2^m)m^{m-1} \\notag \\\\\n&\\equiv m^m + 2^n \\cdot m^m \\notag \\\\\n&\\equiv m^m + 2^n, \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nwhere we have used in the last step that $m^m$ is odd; writing $m^m$ as $2a+1$ shows that $2^n(2a+1) = 2^{n+1}a + 2^n \\equiv 2^n \\pmod{2^{n+1}}$.\n\nSince the numbers $m^m$ from the lesser group are different modulo $2^{n+1}$, the numbers from the greater group therefore are also different modulo $2^{n+1}$. Moreover, from (7) it follows that the numbers from the lesser group are different from those from the greater group modulo $2^{n+1}$. Indeed, suppose for a contradiction that $(2^n+m)2^{n+m} \\equiv k^k \\pmod{2^{n+1}}$ with $1 \\le k, m \\le 2^{n-1}$, then it follows from (7) that $m^m \\equiv m^m + 2^n \\equiv k^k \\pmod{2^n}$. So because of the induction hypothesis, it follows that $m = k$. But in that case we have $(2^n+m)2^{n+m} \\equiv m^m + 2^n \\not\\equiv m^m \\pmod{2^{n+1}}$ and we obtain the desired contradiction.\n\nSo we conclude that no number from the lesser group and greater group has the same residue class as any other number from these two groups. This completes the induction step, and by induction it therefore follows that the given statement is true for all positive integers $n$. $\\square$\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/NLD_ABooklet_2023_p31_data_67a0a5a712.png)",

For $n=1$, the only number in the sequence is $1^1$, so the given statement is trivially true.\n\nFor the induction step, we are to show that for $n \\ge 1$, the numbers $1^1, 3^3, 5^5, \\dots, (2^{n+1}-1)2^{n+1-1}$ are in different residue classes modulo $2^{n+1}$, given the induction hypothesis that $1^1, 3^3, 5^5, \\dots, (2^n-1)2^{n-1}$ are in different residue classes modulo $2^n$.\n\nSo suppose that that is the case. We split the numbers $1^1, 3^3, 5^5, \\dots, (2^{n+1}-1)2^{n+1-1}$ into two groups, namely $1^1, 3^3, 5^5, \\dots, (2^n-1)2^{n-1}$, which we will call the *lesser group*, and $(2^n+1)2^{n+1}, (2^n+3)2^{n+3}, \\dots, (2^{n+1}-1)2^{n+1-1}$, which we will call the *greater group*. First note that the numbers in the lesser group are also all in different residue classes modulo $2^{n+1}$.\n\nNote that because $\\varphi(2^{n+1}) = 2^n$, we have $a^k \\equiv a^\\ell \\pmod{2^{n+1}}$ for $k, \\ell, a$ such that $k \\equiv \\ell \\pmod{2^n}$ and $a$ is odd. We will use this observation to compare the residue classes of the greater group to those of the lesser group.\n\nWrite the numbers in the greater group as $(2^n+m)2^{n+m}$ for $1 \\le m \\le 2^n-1$ and odd. Expanding $(2^n+m)2^{n+m}$ using Newton's binomial, we note that any term with at least two factors $2^n$ is congruent to 0 modulo $2^{n+1}$. We thus find modulo $2^{n+1}$ that\n\n$$\n\\begin{align} \n(2^n + m)2^{n+m} &\\equiv m2^{n+m} + (2^n + m)m2^{n+m-1}2^n + 2^{2n}(\\cdots) \\notag \\\\\n&\\equiv m2^{n+m} + (2^n + m)m2^{n+m-1}2^n \\notag \\\\\n&\\equiv m^m + (2^{2n} + 2^m)m^{m-1} \\notag \\\\\n&\\equiv m^m + 2^n \\cdot m^m \\notag \\\\\n&\\equiv m^m + 2^n, \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nwhere we have used in the last step that $m^m$ is odd; writing $m^m$ as $2a+1$ shows that $2^n(2a+1) = 2^{n+1}a + 2^n \\equiv 2^n \\pmod{2^{n+1}}$.\n\nSince the numbers $m^m$ from the lesser group are different modulo $2^{n+1}$, the numbers from the greater group therefore are also different modulo $2^{n+1}$. Moreover, from (7) it follows that the numbers from the lesser group are different from those from the greater group modulo $2^{n+1}$. Indeed, suppose for a contradiction that $(2^n+m)2^{n+m} \\equiv k^k \\pmod{2^{n+1}}$ with $1 \\le k, m \\le 2^{n-1}$, then it follows from (7) that $m^m \\equiv m^m + 2^n \\equiv k^k \\pmod{2^n}$. So because of the induction hypothesis, it follows that $m = k$. But in that case we have $(2^n+m)2^{n+m} \\equiv m^m + 2^n \\not\\equiv m^m \\pmod{2^{n+1}}$ and we obtain the desired contradiction."

Then we are done in at most $1+(3n-5)=3n-4$ moves. $\\square$\n\n**Claim 3.** There are no moves so that the maximum $\\max(a_1, \\dots, a_n)$ increases by 3 or more.\n\n*Proof.* We proceed by contradiction. To make a move in which a box receives more than 3 stones, the box that was distributed from in that move would have to contain at least $3n+1$ stones. This contradicts the fact that there are only $3n$ stones. To make a move in which a box receives exactly 3 stones, the box that was distributed from should contain at least $2n+1$ stones. Any box that contains the highest number of stones after this move, must contain at least $2n+4$ stones, as the maximum has increased by at least 3. That box therefore must also have contained at least $2n+1$ stones before this move. This requires $4n+2$ stones and is therefore a contradiction. $\\square$\n\n**Claim 4.** If $\\max(a_1, \\dots, a_n) = 3$, then $f(a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n) \\ge 3n-4$.\n\n*Proof.* Suppose for a contradiction that we can move all the stones into a single box in $3n-5$ or fewer moves. Because of Claim 3, there are no moves where the maximum increases by 3 or more. That means there are at least two moves where the maximum increases by 2. Such moves we will call *large* moves. Note that each box receives at least 1 stone on a big move. Let move $i$ be the first large move, and let move $j$ be the last large move. Since a large move can only be performed with a box containing at least $n+1$ stones and each box starts with 3 stones $i-1 \\ge (n+1)-3$, or equivalently $i \\ge n-1$.\n\nLet $m$ be the number of empty boxes at the beginning of move $j$. Since each box contains at least 1 stone after move $i$, we must have made at least one move per box that is empty by the beginning of move $j$. Therefore $(j-1)-i \\ge m$. Since each box receives at least 1 stone again, after move $j$ there are at most $m$ boxes containing exactly 1 stone; the other boxes contain at least 2 stones each. Since we don't make any more large moves after move $j$, it therefore takes at least $m+2(n-1-m) = 2(n-1)-m$ moves afterwards to empty $n-1$ of the boxes. So the total number of moves is at least\n\n$$\ni + (j - i) + 2(n - 1) - m \\ge (n - 1) + (m + 1) + 2(n - 1) - m = 3n - 2,\n$$\n\nwhich contradicts our assumption that we could put all the stones into a single box in $3n-5$ or fewer moves. $\\square$",

To see this, pick a box containing the highest number of stones, pick a different non-empty box and distribute the stones from that box such that at least one stone goes into the box containing the highest number of stones. It follows that $f(a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n) \\le 3n - \\max(a_1, \\dots, a_n)$. Specifically, if $\\max(a_1, \\dots, a_n) \\ge 5$, then $f(a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n) \\le 3n - 5$. The rest of the proof will follow from the following four claims.\n\n**Claim 1.** If $\\max(a_1, \\dots, a_n) = 4$, then $f(a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n) \\le 3n - 5$.\n\n*Proof.* Let $A_1$ be the box containing the highest number of stones, and $A_2$ be the box containing the second-highest number of stones. Note that we must have $a_1 = 4$ and $a_2 \\ge \\frac{3n-4}{n-1} = 3 - \\frac{1}{n-1}$. Since $a_2$ is integer and $n \\ge 3$, that means $a_2 \\ge 3$. While there exists a box other than $A_1$ or $A_2$ containing 2 or more stones, do the move consisting of distributing the stones in that box in such a way that $A_1$ and $A_2$ each receive a stone. The distribution $b_1, \\dots, b_n$ we obtain by performing these moves has the properties that $b_3 + \\dots + b_n \\le n-2$ and that $b_1 - b_2 = a_1 - a_2 \\le 1$. Therefore we have $b_1 + b_2 \\ge 3n - (n-2) = 2n+2$, from which it follows that $b_2 = \\frac{1}{2}(b_2+b_1) \\ge \\frac{1}{2}(b_1+b_2-1) \\ge \\frac{1}{2}(2n+1) = n+\\frac{1}{2}$. Since $b_2$ is integer, we therefore have $b_2 \\ge n+1$. Now we can do a move consisting of distributing $A_2$'s stones in such a way that $A_1$ receives 2 stones. After that, while there exists a box other than $A_1$ that contains stones, we do a move consisting of distributing the stones in that box in such a way that $A_1$ receives 1 stone.

Therefore $f(2), f(3), f(5)$ has 4, 6, 4 positive divisors respectively, as the number of positive divisors of the prime factorisation $p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_n^{e_n}$ is $(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1)\\cdots(e_n + 1)$.\n\nNow let $p > 5$, and suppose for a contradiction that $f(p)$ has at most 6 positive divisors. First note that modulo 7, we have that $f(p) \\equiv 3^p + (-3)^p + 5^p + (-5)^p - 0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$ as $p$ is odd.\n\nNext consider $f(p)$ modulo 11. By Fermat's little theorem, we have $a^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ for any integer $a \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$, so the residue class of $f(p)$ modulo 11 is constant on any residue class modulo 10.

Repeating the same argument shows that the same holds for $\\{3^{-1}, 4^{-1}, 5^{-1}, 9^{-1}\\}$ (as $-1 \\equiv 3^2 \\pmod{10}$) and $\\{3^{-3}, 4^{-3}, 5^{-3}, 9^{-3}\\}$ as well.

Since the sum of the cards is 1000, this pupil should be able to distribute the cards among the 100 boxes. Because of the pigeonhole principle, there is at least one box with 11 cards. The sum of these 11 cards is $11 \\cdot \\frac{1000}{1001} = 11(1 - \\frac{1}{1001}) = 11 - \\frac{11}{1001} = 11 - \\frac{1}{91}$. We are now going to show that this is the smallest possible value, i.e. $c = 11 - \\frac{1}{91}$.\n\nFor a random pupil, we first consider those distributions for which the maximum of the sums of the cards per box is as small as possible. From these distributions we then pick a distribution for which the number of boxes having their sum equal to this maximum, is as small as possible. Let $d_1 \\le d_2 \\le \\dots \\le d_{100}$ be the sums corresponding to the 100 boxes in this distribution, ordered from low to high (with the last $k$ of them equal to the maximum). Since the sum of all cards is at most 1000, we have that\n\n$$\n99d_1 + d_{100} \\le d_1 + d_2 + \\dots + d_{100} \\le 1000.\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, moving a positive card from the box (with sum) $d_{100}$ to the box (with sum) $d_1$ cannot create a better distribution per assumption: i.e. the new distribution does not have a smaller maximum, or less than $k$ boxes equal to this maximum value. This means that the new value of $d_1$ is at least equal to $d_{100}$. If $d_{100} \\le 10$ we are immediately done, because $10 < 11 - \\frac{1}{91}$. So we may assume that $d_{100} > 10$. Since each card is at most 1, this implies that box $d_{100}$ contains at least 11 positive cards. This in turn implies that there is a card in this box with positive value at most $\\frac{d_{100}}{11}$. Therefore, if we move this card to box $d_1$, then it must hold that\n\n$$\nd_1 + \\frac{d_{100}}{11} \\ge \\text{``new value of box } d_1\\text{''} \\ge d_{100}.\n$$\n\nWe can rewrite this as $11d_1 \\ge 10d_{100}$. Combining this with the first equation, we find\n\n$$\n91d_{100} = 90d_{100} + d_{100} \\le 99d_1 + d_{100} \\le 1000.\n$$\n\nSo, for each pupil, the smallest maximum of the sums of the cards per box is $d_{100} \\le \\frac{1000}{91} = \\frac{1001}{91} - \\frac{1}{91} = 11 - \\frac{1}{91}$. $\\square$",

Now we substitute $x = \\frac{m}{n}$ and $y = \\frac{1}{n}$ from which we get that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(\\frac{m+1}{n}) &= \\frac{f(\\frac{m}{n}) + f(\\frac{1}{n})}{f(\\frac{m}{n^2}) - \\frac{m}{n^2} + 1} - \\frac{n}{m+1} = \\frac{\\frac{m}{n} - \\frac{n}{m} + \\frac{1}{n} - n}{\\frac{m}{n^2} - \\frac{n^2}{m} - \\frac{m}{n^2} + 1} - \\frac{n}{m+1} \\\\\n&= \\frac{(m+1)(\\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{n}{m})}{n(\\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{n}{m})} - \\frac{n}{m+1} = \\frac{m+1}{n} - \\frac{n}{m+1}.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis completes the induction to $m$, and with it the complete proof. $\\square$",

      "statement_latex": "Now we would like to use equation (8) inductively, but the base case $x = 1$ does not work, because $f(1) = 0$. As a new base case we would like to use $f(4) = \\frac{15}{4}$ from before, which did not result in a contradiction, but rather in $f(1) = 0$.\n\n\\textbf{Lemma.} We must have $f(4) = \\frac{15}{4}$.\n\n\\textit{Proof.} We actually use the same trick as above to calculate $f(4)$, but now with the fact that we know $f(1)$ instead of $f(2)$. With $x = y = 2$, we again find that $2f(2) = (f(4) + \\frac{1}{4})(f(4) - 3)$. By substituting $x = 2$ in (8) we find $f(2) = (f(3) + \\frac{1}{3})(f(2) - 1)$ and by substituting $x = 3$ in (8) we find $f(3) = (f(4) + \\frac{1}{4})(f(3) - 2)$. We can solve this system of three equations by rewriting the second equation as\n\n$$\nf(3) = \\frac{f(2)}{f(2) - 1} - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{f(2) - 1} + \\frac{2}{3},\n$$\n\nor $f(2) = \\frac{1}{f(3) - \\frac{2}{3}} + 1$. Similarly, it follows from the third equation that $f(4) = \\frac{2}{f(3) - 2} + \\frac{3}{4}$ which we can rewrite as $f(3) - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}f(4) + 1$. Combining everything, we find that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} \\left(f(4) + \\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\left(f(4) - 3\\right) &= 2f(2) = 2\\left(\\frac{1}{f(3) - \\frac{2}{3}} + 1\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{f(4) - \\frac{3}{4}}{\\frac{4}{3}f(4) + 1} + 1\\right) \\\\ &= \\frac{2f(4) - \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{8}{3}f(4) + 2}{\\frac{4}{3}f(4) + 1} = \\frac{\\frac{14}{3}f(4) + \\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{4}{3}f(4) + 1}. \\end{aligned}\n$$"

We call this number the *L-sum* of a word. For each word, the L-sum is a non-negative integer. Furthermore, for every move Eva makes, the L-sum becomes one lower. Indeed, when switching 'L' and 'R', the position of the 'L' that Eva switches becomes one lower. Therefore, since the L-sum cannot become negative, Eva can always do only a finite number of turns.\n\n(b) Of all the possible words of length $n$ that Eva considers, the L-sum is the largest with the word 'RR...RL...LL', where all $\\ell$ characters 'L' are on the right side of the word. On the contrary, the L-sum is smallest for the word 'LL...LRR...R', where all $\\ell$ characters 'L' are on the left side of the word. In this word, Eva cannot do any more turns, because there is nowhere an 'L' directly to the right of an 'R'. To compute the difference in L-sums, note that the left-most 'L' in 'RR...RL...LL' and the left-most 'L' in 'L...LRR...R' differ $n - \\ell$ from each other in position. The same is true for all subsequent characters 'L', from left to right. Thus, the difference in L-sum between these two words is $\\ell(n - \\ell)$. We already saw that the L-sum of a word becomes exactly one smaller at each turn: an upper bound on the maximum number of turns is thus $\\ell(n - \\ell)$.\n\nEva can also actually do $\\ell(n - \\ell)$ turns if she starts with the word 'RR...RL...LL'. For the first $n - \\ell$ turns, she uses only the leftmost 'L', and the result is the word 'LRR...RL...LL' with $\\ell - 1$ times an 'L' on the right side. Next, she chooses the second 'L' from the left, and in $n - \\ell$ turns she makes the word 'LLRR...RL...LL' with $\\ell - 2$ times an 'L' on the right side. Eva does this with all $\\ell$ the characters 'L'. In total, she can take $\\ell(n - \\ell)$ turns before she ends with 'L...LRR...R'.\n\n(c) In the previous part of the problem, we already saw that Eva can do at most $\\ell(n - \\ell)$ turns. Consider the function $f(\\ell) = \\ell(n - \\ell)$. This is a quadratic function with zeros at $\\ell = 0$ and $\\ell = n$. So the maximum is at $\\ell = \\frac{1}{2}n$. If $n$ is even, then Eva can do as many turns as possible at $\\ell = \\frac{n}{2}$. (The number of turns is then $f(\\frac{n}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4}n^2$.) If $n$ is odd, the maximum of this function is not at an integer value of $\\ell$ and we see that Eva can do as many turns as possible at $\\ell = \\frac{n-1}{2}$ and $\\ell = \\frac{n+1}{2}$. (The number of turns is then $f(\\frac{n-1}{2}) = f(\\frac{n+1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4}(n^2 - 1)$.)",

So all the numbers in the sequence $(x_i)$ are integers and we see that $x_{n+1}$ and $x_{n-1}$ always have the same parity. In particular, $x_{2n}$ is always odd. So $2y_{2n} + \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{4y_{2n}+3}{2} = \\frac{x_{2n+1}}{2}$ is always an integer. To show that they are also positive, we prove by induction that $x_n$ is an increasing sequence of positive numbers. This is indeed true for $x_1 > x_0 > 0$. Now suppose as induction hypothesis that $x_n > x_{n-1} > 0$. Then we also find that $x_{n+1} - x_n = 3x_n - x_{n-1} > x_n - x_{n-1} > 0$.

So the reflection in $BC$ transforms $\\triangle PKH$ into itself, so $M$ lies on $BC$ and therefore is the midpoint of $KN$.\n\nLet $O$ be the centre of $\\omega$.

Moreover, the number must be at least 2, otherwise the game would have already ended. In particular, at the start of Quintijn's turn, the number of integers is always at least 3.\n\nFor any residue class *i* modulo 3, denote the number of integers on the board inside *i* with $x_i$. If *i*, *j*, *k* are residue classes modulo 3 with $i - j \\equiv k$, then we denote any move removing integers *a* and *b* with $a \\equiv i \\pmod 3$ and $b \\equiv j \\pmod 3$ by $(i, j) \\to k$.\n\nNote Johan cannot reach a position in which $x_1 = x_2 = 0$ unless at the start of his turn either $x_1 = 2$ and $x_2 = 0$, or $x_1 = 0$ and $x_2 = 2$ (or $x_1 = 0$ and $x_2 = 0$) hold. In particular, if at the start of his turn at least one of $x_1$ and $x_2$ is odd, then he cannot reach a position in which $x_1 = x_2 = 0$.\n\nOn the other hand, if $x_1$ and $x_2$ are not both 0, Quintijn can always make a move such at least one of $x_1$ and $x_2$ becomes odd, as we will show below.\n\nFirst suppose that $x_1$ and $x_2$ are both even. Then at least one of $x_1$ and $x_2$ must be at least 2, say $x_1 \\ge 2$. Since Quintijn always has an odd number of integers left at the start of his turn, there must also be an integer on the board that is divisible by 3. With $(0, 1) \\to 2$, Quintijn ensures that $x_1$ decreases by 1 and $x_2$ increases by 1, so $x_1$ and $x_2$ both become odd.\n\nNow suppose that at least one of $x_1$ and $x_2$ are odd. If there exists an $i$ with $x_i \\ge 2$, then performing any move $(i, i) \\to 0$ will not change the parity of $x_1$ and $x_2$, so at least one of them remains odd. Otherwise all $x_i \\le 1$ so there are at most 3 integers left, and in fact we must have equality here as there are always at least 3 integers left at the start of Quintijn's turn. So $x_0 = x_1 = x_2 = 1$, hence Quintijn can perform the move $(1, 0) \\to 1$.\n\nTherefore Quintijn can always make a move that causes at least one of $x_1$ and $x_2$ to be odd. Now the strategy of making such a move is winning for",
