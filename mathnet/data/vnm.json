This number is divisible by 3, so it should divisible by 9. So $6x_1^2 + y_0^2$ is divisible by 3. From which we have $y_0$ is divisible by 3. Put $y_0 = 3y_1$ where $y_1$ is an integer.\n\nPutting back in original expression $2x_0^2 + 3y_0^2$, we have $18x_1^2 + 27y_1^2 = 9(2x_1^2 + 3y_1^2)$ is a perfect square.

Thus, in $A$ does not exist a perfect square.\n\nb. Firstly we will prove that the product of any three numbers from $A$ also belongs $A$.

Choose from them $2k-1$ numbers. Then, by induction hypothesis, product of these numbers belongs $A$. Then this product\ntogether with two remaining numbers forms a triple of numbers from A. By (*) their product belongs to A, which means product of any $2k+1$ numbers from A belongs A. Thus, the statement holds for $n = 2k+1$.\n\nBy induction principle, we have the required statement.\n\nNow, apply result of part a for the product, we have done.",

Hence, if we change pairs $(a_1, b_i), (a_j, b_1)$ into pairs $(a_1, b_1), (a_j, b_i)$ then we still have a regular partition. Remove the pair $(a_1, b_1)$, we have $2(n-1)$ numbers that can be divided $n-1$ regular pairs.

Then $(a_2, b_3), (a_3, b_1)$ are the remaining regular pairs in the given partition. We have $-2013 < a_1 - b_2 < 2013$, $a_2 - b_1 < a_1 - b_1 < 2013$ and $a_2 - b_1 > a_3 - b_1 > -2013$ so the pair $(a_2, b_1)$ is regular.

Suppose that $(a_1, b_1)$ and $(a_j, b_n)$ ($1 < i, j \\le n$) are two regular pairs in this partition.

For each $i=1,2,3,...,11$ then the number of subsets contain $a_i$ is $d(a_i)$, so the numbers of two subsets having a common element $a_i$ is $\\binom{d(a_i)}{2}$. Therefore, we have\n\nb. Similarly as in the previous case, let $b_1, b_2, b_3, \\dots, b_9$ be the type of candies and $d(b_i), i = 1, 9$ be the number of candies of each type. We have\n\n$$\nd(b_1) + d(b_2) + d(b_3) + \\dots + d(b_9) = 2013.\n$$\n\nWe need to find the minimum value of $\\sum_{i=1}^{9} (d(b_i))^2$.\n\nNotice that if there exists $d(b_i) - d(b_j) \\ge 2$ for some $1 \\le i, j \\le 9$ then we can decrease $d(b_i)$ by 1 and increase $d(b_j)$ by 1 then\n\n$$\n(d(b_i))^2 + (d(b_j))^2 - (d(b_i) - 1)^2 - (d(b_j) + 1)^2 = 2(d(b_i) - d(b_j)) > 0.\n$$\n\nTherefore, to obtain the minimum value, we need $d(b_i) - d(b_j) \\le 1$ for all $i, j \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 9\\}$.\n\nWithout loss of generality, we assume that $d(a_1) \\le d(a_2) \\le d(a_3) \\le \\dots \\le d(a_9)$. From the above argument, $d(a_i)$ can be either $k, k+1$ for some positive integer $k$. Suppose that there are $t$ numbers $k$ and $9-t$ numbers $k+1$. We need to find the minimum value of\n\n$$\nM = \\frac{1}{2} (tk^2 + (9-t)(k+1)^2 - 2013) \\text{ with } tk + (9-t)(k+1) = 2013 \\Leftrightarrow t = 9k - 2004.\n$$\n\nSubstitute into $M$, we have\n\n$$\nM = \\frac{1}{2}((9k - 2004)k^2 + (2013 - 9k)(k+1)^2 - 2013).\n$$\n\nSince $0 \\le t \\le 9$, we have $0 \\le 9k - 2004 \\le 9 \\Rightarrow \\frac{2004}{9} \\le k \\le \\frac{2013}{9} \\Rightarrow k = 223$.\n\nWith $k=223$ then $M = \\frac{1}{2}(3 \\cdot 223^2 + 6 \\cdot 224^2 - 2013)$.\n\nIn this case, the minimum value is $M = \\frac{1}{2}(3 \\cdot 223^2 + 6 \\cdot 224^2 - 2013)$ which can be obtained when we have 3 numbers 223 and 6 numbers 224."
