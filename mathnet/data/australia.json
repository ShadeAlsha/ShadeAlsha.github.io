Then we get either $4a-3, 3a-2, a$ or $2a-1, 3a-2, 5a-4$. All of the numbers so far have the form $ka-k+1$ where $k$ is some positive integer. This will continue because if we rub out an integer and the remaining two integers are $ra-r+1$ and $sa-s+1$, then the new integer will be $(r+s)a-(r+s)+1$. Thus the pattern continues.\n\nIf Gerry gets the number 2010, then 2010 must equal $ka - k + 1$ for some positive integer $k$. So $a - 1$ must be a factor of $2009 = 7 \\times 7 \\times 41$.

Hence our sequence is\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{lclcl}\na_1 & = & 2010 & & \\\\\na_2 & = & 0 & & \\\\\na_3 & = & 0 & & \\\\\na_4 & = & 0 & & \\\\\\vdots & & & & \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nIt is easy to verify that this sequence satisfies the given properties.\n\n$$\n\\text{Thus } a_{2011} + a_{2012} = 0 + 0 = 0.\n$$\n\n\\textbf{Case 3.} $a_1 \\neq 0$ and $a_2 \\neq 0$. Write $a_1 = x$, $a_2 = y$ with $x, y \\neq 0$. Note that $x + y = 2010$.

It is easy to verify that this 6-cycle satisfies the given properties for the sequence.\n\nThus since $2011 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6}$ and $2012 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{6}$ it follows that $a_{2011} + a_{2012} = a_1 + a_2 = 2010$.\n\nIn conclusion we have shown that the only possible values for $a_{2011} + a_{2012}$ are 0 and 2010.",

Hence our sequence is\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{lclcl}\na_1 & = & 2010 & & \\\\\na_2 & = & 0 & & \\\\\na_3 & = & 0 & & \\\\\na_4 & = & 0 & & \\\\\n\\vdots & & & & \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nIt is easy to verify that this sequence satisfies the given properties.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Thus } a_{2011} + a_{2012} = 0 + 0 = 0.\n\\]\n\n\\textbf{Case 3.} $a_1 \\neq 0$ and $a_2 \\neq 0$. Write $a_1 = x$, $a_2 = y$ with $x, y \\neq 0$. Note that $x + y = 2010$. Using $a_n = \\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_{n-2}}$ for $n = 3, 4, \\dots$, we compute\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{lclcl}\na_1 & = & x & & \\\\\na_2 & = & y & & \\\\\na_3 & = & \\frac{y}{x} & & \\\\\na_4 & = & \\frac{1}{x} & & \\\\\na_5 & = & \\frac{1}{y} & & \\\\\na_6 & = & \\frac{x}{y} & & \\\\\na_7 & = & x & & \\\\\na_8 & = & y & & \\\\\n\\vdots & & & & \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nNote that $a_1 = a_7$ and $a_2 = a_8$. Since the value of $a_n$ depends only on the values of $a_{n-1}$ and $a_{n-2}$ for $n \\ge 3$, this means that we have entered a 6-cycle. Hence $a_n = a_{n+6}$ for all positive integers $n$. It is easy to verify that this 6-cycle satisfies the given properties for the sequence.\n\nThus since $2011 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6}$ and $2012 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{6}$ it follows that $a_{2011} + a_{2012} = a_1 + a_2 = 2010$.\n\nIn conclusion we have shown that the only possible values for $a_{2011} + a_{2012}$ are 0 and 2010.",

All points on this line are given by $ru + (1-r)v$ as $r$ ranges over the real numbers. Thus the equation of the line is $z = ru + (1-r)v = v + r(u-v)$. Thus $r = \\frac{z-v}{u-v}$. Taking the complex conjugate of both sides yields $r = \\frac{\\bar{z}-\\bar{v}}{\\bar{u}-\\bar{v}}$.

Let $a^2, b^2, c^2$ be the complex numbers representing points $A, B, C$, respectively.\n\nNote that the internal and external angle bisectors at $A$ are the lines $AQ$ and $AS$, respectively. These intersect the unit circle at the midpoints of the two arcs which join $B$ and $C$. These two points are thus $bc$ and $-bc$ in some order. By choosing the value of $b$ appropriately (there are two choices for $b$ such that $B = b^2$) we may assume that $AQ$ intersects the circumcircle at $bc$ and $AS$ intersects the circumcircle at $-bc$.

Thus if H is the orthocentre and H' is the intersection of AH with the circumcircle, we have that R is the midpoint of HH'. It is well known that $\\vec{OH} = 3 \\vec{OG}$, where G is the centroid and O is the circumcentre of triangle ABC. Since $G = \\frac{a^2+b^2+c^2}{3}$, we have $H = a^2+b^2+c^2$. Furthermore if $H' = z$, then since A, H, H' are collinear, we must have $H' - A = r(H - A)$ for some real number $r$. Thus $z - a^2 = r(b^2 + c^2)$. Taking the complex conjugate and using $\\bar{z} = \\frac{1}{z}$, $\\bar{a} = \\frac{1}{a}$, $\\bar{b} = \\frac{1}{b}$, $\\bar{c} = \\frac{1}{a}$, we find $\\frac{1}{z} - \\frac{1}{a^2} = \\frac{r(b^2+c^2)}{b^2c^2} = \\frac{z-a^2}{b^2c^2}$. A little tidying up allows us to cancel a factor of $z - a^2$, since $z \\neq a^2$, and thus find $z = -\\frac{b^2c^2}{a^2}$.

As in the first alternative, we define a \\textit{good} pair to be two persons who are not acquainted but who share a common acquaintance with someone else.\n\nLet the total number of edges in the graph be $E$. Thus there are at most $\\binom{n}{2} - E$ good pairs. If $E \\ge n - 1$, then the number of good pairs is at most $\\binom{n}{2} - (n-1) = \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}$.\n\nSuppose instead that $E \\le n - 2$. A well known theorem states that a connected graph on $n$ vertices has at least $n-1$ edges. Since we have at most $n-2$ edges, this means that our graph is disconnected and can be partitioned into two smaller subgraphs, $G_1$ and $G_2$, say, such that there are no edges going between $G_1$ and $G_2$. Consider a person $X$, say, in $G_1$ and a person, $Y$ say, in $G_2$. Since $G_1$ and $G_2$ are disconnected, this means that $X$ and $Y$ cannot have a common acquaintance. Thus the pair $X,Y$ is not good. If $G_1$ has $m$ vertices then $G_2$ has $n-m$ vertices then this means we have at least $m(n-m)$ pairs which are not good. Note that $f(m) = m(n-m)$ is a negative quadratic in $m$ and thus achieves its minimum at the extremal points permitted for $m$, namely at $m = 1$ or $m = n-1$. Since $f(1) = f(n-1) = n-1$ we conclude that there are at least $n-1$ pairs which are not good. Thus the number of good pairs is once again less than or equal to $\\binom{n}{2} - (n-1) = \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} = \\binom{n-1}{2}$.\n\nThe equality case is constructed in the same way as the first alternative.",

If $X$ and $Y$ are a good pair, this means that there exists a point $Z$ such that $XZ$ and $YZ$ are edges. Thus to each good pair, we can associate at least one pair of edges. Furthermore different good pairs lead to different pairs of associated edges. Thus the number of good pairs is less than or equal to the number of pairs of edges. Thus the number of good pairs is at most $\\binom{E}{2}$.\n\nAlso since there are $E$ edges, this means that there are $\\binom{n}{2} - E$ non-edges. Thus the number of good pairs is bounded above by $\\binom{n}{2} - E$.\n\nThus the number of good pairs is at most $\\min\\{\\binom{E}{2}, \\binom{n}{2} - E\\}$. Consider the graphs of the two functions $f(E) = \\frac{E(E-1)}{2}$ and $g(E) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} - E$ for fixed $n$. Note that $f(0) = f(1)$ and that $f(E)$ is an increasing function for $E \\ge 1$. Also note that $g(E)$ is a decreasing function of $E$. Thus the maximum value of $\\min\\{f(E), g(E)\\}$ occurs when $f(E) = g(E)$. Solving the equation $\\frac{E(E-1)}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} - E$ yields $E = n-1$ or $E = -n$. Only the first solution is valid.

Let there be an edge between vertices $A$ and $B$ if persons $A$ and $B$ are acquainted. Since there are $k$ good pairs, this graph has at most $\\binom{n}{2} - k$ edges.\n\nLet $X$ and $Y$ be a good pair. Thus there is at least one vertex $Z$ such that $XZ$ and $YZ$ are both edges. Hence to each good pair we can associate at least two edges. Furthermore any edge, say $PQ$, which arises from a good pair can only arise from at most $n - 2$ good pairs. This is because for each other point $R$ in the graph, if $R$ is joined to exactly one of $P$ or $Q$, then we add one to the count as it pertains to the edge $PQ$ arising from a good pair. In all other cases we add zero to the count as it pertains to the edge $PQ$ arising from a good pair.\n\nThus each edge arising from a good pair is counted at most $n - 2$ times.

This simplifies to $k \\le \\frac{n^2-3n+2}{2} = \\binom{n-1}{2}$.\n\nFinally we show that $k = \\binom{n-1}{2}$ is attainable. Consider the scenario where one person, say $P$, knows all the other people, but none of the other people know each other. Then every pair of the $n-1$ persons not containing $P$ is a good pair. Thus there are exactly $k = \\binom{n-1}{2}$ good pairs in this scenario."

Since we stipulated that $2^m < 2010^{2010^{2010}}$ and $r \\le 2$, we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned} 2^{m+r} &< 2010^{2010^{2010}} \\cdot 4 \\\\ &< 2010^{2010^{2010}} + 1 \\\\ &< 2010^{2011^{2010}} \\\\ &< 2048^{2048^{2048}} \\\\ &= 2^{11 \\cdot 2^{11 \\cdot 2^{11}}} \\\\ &< 2^{11 \\cdot 2^{2^{15}}} \\quad (11 < 2^4) \\\\ &< 2^{2^{4+2^{15}}} \\\\ &< 2^{2^{2^{19}}}. \\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nThus $m+r < 2^{2^{19}}$, as required.\n\nThe second is that we performed $t = \\frac{1}{3}(2010^{2010^{2010}} - 2^m - 2r)$ moves at some stage. We need to justify why $t$ is non-negative. Note that $2^{2010^{2010}}|2010^{2010^{2010}}$, thus $m > 2010^{2010}$. Furthermore, $2^m < 2010^{2010^{2010}}$. Thus $2010^{2010^{2010}} - 2^m$ is a positive integer which is divisible by $2^{2010^{2010}}$. Thus $2^{2010^{2010}} \\le 2010^{2010^{2010}} - 2^m$. Thus $2^m + 2r < 2010^{2010^{2010}}$.",

Informally, $2 * a$ represents $2^{2^{\\cdot \\cdot 2}}$ where there are $a$ 2s in the power tower.\n\n**Proof.** We show how to convert $(a - i, 2 * i, 0, 0)$ to $(a - i - 1, 2 * (i + 1), 0, 0)$ for $0 < i < a$. We do this by via\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n(a - i, 2 * i, 0, 0) &\\rightarrow (a - i, 0, 2^{2*i}, 0, 0) && \\text{(using lemma 1)} \\\\\n&= (a - i, 0, 2 * (i + 1), 0) \\\\\n&\\rightarrow (a - i - 1, 2 * (i + 1), 0, 0) && \\text{(type 2 operation).}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nNow use a type 1 operation to do $(a, 0, 0, 0) \\rightarrow (a - 1, 2, 0, 0)$.

The number of operations that may be performed is necessarily finite and thus the number of coins that may be achieved is bounded.\n\n2. If the operations are chosen carefully enough, it is possible to achieve incredibly huge amounts of coins. Indeed from the initial condition it is possible to arrive at $(0, 1, 2^{14}, 0, 0, 0)$ from which it is possible to achieve more than $2 * (2 * 2^{14})$ in the last box! This is far, far more than the current estimate for the number of particles in the universe!",

Here is the proof. Since we stipulated that $2^m < 2010^{2010^{2010}}$ and $r \\le 2$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} 2^{m+r} &< 2010^{2010^{2010}} \\cdot 4 \\\\ &< 2010^{2010^{2010}} + 1 \\\\ &< 2010^{2011^{2010}} \\\\ &< 2048^{2048^{2048}} \\\\ &= 2^{11 \\cdot 2^{11 \\cdot 2^{11}}} \\\\ &< 2^{11 \\cdot 2^{2^{15}}} \\quad (11 < 2^4) \\\\ &< 2^{2^{4+2^{15}}} \\\\ &< 2^{2^{2^{19}}}. \\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus $m+r < 2^{2^{19}}$, as required.\n\nThe second is that we performed $t = \\frac{1}{3}(2010^{2010^{2010}} - 2^m - 2r)$ moves at some stage. We need to justify why $t$ is non-negative. Note that $2^{2010^{2010}}|2010^{2010^{2010}}$, thus $m > 2010^{2010}$. Furthermore, $2^m < 2010^{2010^{2010}}$. Thus $2010^{2010^{2010}} - 2^m$ is a positive integer which is divisible by $2^{2010^{2010}}$. Thus $2^{2010^{2010}} \\le 2010^{2010^{2010}} - 2^m$. Thus $2^m + 2r < 2010^{2010^{2010}}$."

Let us delete these $\\ell$ occurrences of $j$ from $(i_1, i_2, i_3, \\ldots, i_k)$ and replace them with $j$ occurrences of $\\ell$ instead, obtaining a sequence $(i_1, i_2, i'_3, \\ldots, i'_{k'})$.

      "statement_latex": "Based on ideas from the presentation by Sampson Wong, year 12, James Ruse Agricultural High School, NSW. Sampson was a silver medalist with the 2010 Australian IMO team.\n\nThe two important ideas are as follows: First, any $a_n$, with $n > s$, can be decomposed into a sum $a_n = a_{j_1} + a_{j_2}$ with $j_1, j_2 < n$ and $j_1 + j_2 = n$. If say, $j_1 > s$ then we can further decompose $a_{j_1}$ in the same way, and so on until $a_n$ is written as a sum $a_n = a_{i_1} + a_{i_2} + \\cdots + a_{i_k}$ where $1 \\le i_1, i_2, \\ldots, i_k \\le s$.\n\nThe second idea is that suppose we have written $a_n = a_{i_1} + a_{i_2} + \\cdots + a_{i_k}$ as in the first idea, and the term $a_p$ appears at least $q$ times where $1 \\le p \\le s$ and $1 \\le q \\le s$. Then it might occur that $qa_p < pa_q$. In such a situation it would be better to replace $q$ terms of $a_p$ with $p$ terms of $a_q$ in the decomposition of $a_n$, if this were possible. This leads to a consideration of the maximal value of $\\frac{a_i}{i}$ where $1 \\le i \\le s$.\n\nThe putting together of these ideas into a proof which is watertight, however, is a little tricky. We proceed as follows:\n\n**Lemma.** The term $a_n$ satisfies\n\n$$\na_n = \\max\\{a_{i_1} + a_{i_2} + \\cdots + a_{i_k}\\} \\quad (1)\n$$\n\nwhere $i_1, i_2, \\ldots, i_k$ satisfy\n\n$$\n1 \\le i_1, i_2, \\ldots, i_k \\le s \\quad (2)\n$$\n\n$$\ni_1 + i_2 + \\cdots + i_k = n \\quad (3)\n$$\n\n$$\ni_1 + i_2 > s \\quad (4).\n$$\n\n**Proof.** The description of the first idea shows that $a_n = a_{i_1} + a_{i_2} + \\cdots + a_{i_k}$ for some $i_1, i_2, \\ldots, i_k$ satisfying (2), (3) and (4). The only part which is not obvious is (4). However, (4) arises at the very last point when the final term whose index is greater than $s$ is decomposed into two terms whose indices are both less than or equal to $s$.\n\nWe wish to show that $a_n$ is indeed the maximum such sum in (1). Suppose that $a_{i'_1} + a_{i'_2} + \\cdots + a_{i'_k}$ is the maximum such sum in (1) such that $i'_1, i'_2, \\ldots, i'_k$ satisfy (2), (3) and (4). For each $j$ let $t_j = i'_1 + i'_2 + \\cdots + i'_j$. From the definition of $a_n$ we have\n\n$$\na_n = a_{t_k} \\ge a_{t_{k-1}} + a_{i'_k} \\ge a_{t_{k-2}} + a_{i'_{k-1}} + a_{i'_k} \\ge \\dots \\ge a_{i'_1} + a_{i'_2} + \\cdots + a_{i'_k}.\n$$\n\nThus since $a_n$ cannot be greater than the maximum such sum, it must be equal to the maximum such sum."

No sandwich number starts with 1 because the product of 1 and a single digit is a single digit. So the only pairs of sandwich numbers that differ by 82 must start with 4 and they are:\n4123, 4205; 4164, 4246; 4205, 4287; 4246, 4328; 4287, 4369.\n\n### Alternative iii\n\nSuppose we have two sandwich numbers that differ by 82. Neither can end in 0 or 1, so the smaller ends in 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 and the larger ends in 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 respectively.\n\nSince the product of two digits is at most 81, the hundreds digit of a sandwich number cannot be 9. Hence the first digits of the sandwich numbers are the same and the numbers formed from their middle two digits differ by 8.\n\nThe first digit of each divides the number formed from its middle two digits, so the first digit divides the difference 8. Hence the first digit is 1, 2, 4 or 8. No sandwich number starts with 1 because the product of 1 and a single digit is a single digit. Suppose the first digit of each sandwich number was 2 or 8. Since their last digits differ by 2, the difference between the numbers formed from their middle two digits would then differ by 4 or 16 respectively. This is a contradiction.\n\nSo the only pairs of sandwich numbers that differ by 82 must start with 4 and they are:\n4123, 4205; 4164, 4246; 4205, 4287; 4246, 4328; 4287, 4369.\n\n### Alternative iv\n\nIf two sandwich numbers differ by 82, then their first digits are the same or differ by 1. If their first digits differ by 1, then their hundreds digits must be 0 and 9. The hundreds digit of a sandwich number cannot be 0. Hence, if two sandwich numbers differ by 82, then their first digits are the same.\n\nNo sandwich number starts or ends with 1 because the product of 1 and a single digit is a single digit. From Part b, no sandwich number starts or ends with 0. So, if two sandwich numbers differ by 82, then the smaller has the form $a__b$ where $b = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$, or $7$, and the larger has the form $a__c$ where $c = b + 2$. The two-digit middle numbers are respectively $a \\times b$ and $a \\times c$. Hence $a \\times b + 8 = a \\times c = a \\times (b + 2) = a \\times b + a \\times 2$. So $a = 4$. Hence $b \\neq 2$. Thus the only\npairs of sandwich numbers that differ by 82 are:\n4123, 4205; 4164, 4246; 4205, 4287; 4246, 4328; 4287, 4369.",

Then $\\frac{i(i-1)}{2}$ takes every value modulo $p$. If we set $a_k = \\frac{k(k-1)}{2}$, then the sequence $a_1, a_2, \\dots$ is periodic modulo $p$ with period $p$. Hence $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_p$ must be distinct modulo $p$. But this is simply not true, because $a_1 \\equiv 0 \\equiv a_p \\pmod{p}$.\n\nThus we are left only with the case when $n$ is a power of 2. We want to show that $\\frac{i(i-1)}{2}$ takes all values modulo $2^k$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$. This is the same as showing that $i(i-1)$ takes all even values modulo $2^{k+1}$. We claim that as $i$ goes from 1 to $2^k$, all these even values are taken exactly once. Suppose to the contrary that\n\n$$\na(a-1) \\equiv b(b-1) \\pmod{2^{k+1}}\n$$\n\nfor some $a, b$ where $1 \\le a < b \\le 2^k$.

But since $0 < a+b-1 < 2^{k+1}$ and $0 < b-a < 2^k$, neither of these can be divisible by $2^{k+1}$.

Then $\\frac{i(i-1)}{2}$ takes every value modulo $p$. If we set $a_k = \\frac{k(k-1)}{2}$, then the sequence $a_1, a_2, \\dots$ is periodic modulo $p$ with period $p$. Hence $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_p$ must be distinct modulo $p$. But this is simply not true, because $a_1 \\equiv 0 \\equiv a_p \\pmod{p}$.\n\nThus we are left only with the case when $n$ is a power of 2. We want to show that $\\frac{i(i-1)}{2}$ takes all values modulo $2^k$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$. This is the same as showing that $i(i-1)$ takes all even values modulo $2^{k+1}$. We claim that as $i$ goes from 1 to $2^k$, all these even values are taken exactly once. Suppose to the contrary that\n\n$$\na(a-1) \\equiv b(b-1) \\pmod{2^{k+1}}\n$$\n\nfor some $a, b$ where $1 \\le a < b \\le 2^k$. This may be rearranged as\n\n$$\n(a+b-1)(a-b) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2^{k+1}}.\n$$\n\nSince $a+b-1$ and $a-b$ are of opposite parity, one of these expressions is odd while the other is divisible by $2^{k+1}$. But since $0 < a+b-1 < 2^{k+1}$ and $0 < b-a < 2^k$, neither of these can be divisible by $2^{k+1}$.

If $f(1) = 1$, then put $y = 1$ to find $f(x) = x$ for all $x$, however this contradicts condition (1). Therefore, we must have $f(1) = 0$.\n\nSubstitute $x = 1$ and use $f(1) = 0$ to find $f(f(y)) = 2f(y)$ for all $y$. This means that if a number $t$ belongs to the range of the function $f$, then so does $2t$, and by induction so does $2^nt$ for any non-negative integer $n$. So, if there is a real number $a$ such that $f(a) > 0$, then $2^nf(a)$ belongs to the range of $f$ for any real number $n$. But this leads to a contradiction of condition (1). Thus we must have\n\n\\[\nf(x) \\le 0 \\text{ for all } x \\in \\mathbb{R}.\n\\]\n\nBy substituting $\\frac{x}{2}$ for $x$ and $f(y)$ for $y$ and using $f(f(y)) = 2f(y)$, we obtain\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned} & f(xf(y)) + f(y)f\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right) = xf(y) + f\\left(\\frac{x}{2}f(y)\\right) \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\quad & xf(y) - f(xf(y)) = f\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)f(y) - f\\left(\\frac{x}{2}f(y)\\right) \\\\ & \\ge 0, \\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nwhere the last line of the above is true because the values of $f$ are non-positive. Combining this with condition (2) we find that\n\n\\[\nyf(x) \\ge f(xy)\n\\]\n\nIf we set $x > 0$ and $y = \\frac{1}{x}$ in the above inequality and use the fact that $f(1) = 0$, we find that $f(x) \\ge 0$. Also by putting $x = 0$ and $y = 2$ into the above inequality we find that $f(0) \\ge 0$. However, since $f(x) \\le 0$ for all $x$, we conclude that\n\n\\[\nf(x) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } x \\ge 0.\n\\]\n\nIf $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, then clearly this function is one solution to the problem.\n\nIf, on the other hand, there exists $b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(b) \\ne 0$, then by our conclusions above we have $b < 0$ and $f(b) < 0$. Next put $c = f(b)$ to find $f(c) = f(f(b)) = 2f(b) = 2c$. Then for any $x < 0$, we have $cx > 0$ and $2cx > 0$ so that $f(cx) = f(2cx) = 0$. Finally, substitute $y = c$ into condition (2) to find\n\n\\[\nf(2cx) + cf(x) = 2cx + f(cx),\n\\]\n\nfrom which it follows that $f(x) = 2x$ for any negative real number $x$.\n\nHence we have found that the function\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{if } x \\ge 0 \\\\ 2x & \\text{if } x < 0 \\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nis the only other potential solution to the problem.

Next put $x = 1$ and $y = f(1)$ and use $f(f(1)) = f(1)$ to find $f(1)^2 = f(1)$. Thus $f(1) = 0$ or $f(1) = 1$. If $f(1) = 1$, then put $y = 1$ to find $f(x) = x$ for all $x$, however this contradicts condition (1). Therefore, we must have $f(1) = 0$.\n\nSubstitute $x = 1$ and use $f(1) = 0$ to find $f(f(y)) = 2f(y)$ for all $y$. This means that if a number $t$ belongs to the range of the function $f$, then so does $2t$, and by induction so does $2^nt$ for any non-negative integer $n$. So, if there is a real number $a$ such that $f(a) > 0$, then $2^nf(a)$ belongs to the range of $f$ for any real number $n$. But this leads to a contradiction of condition (1). Thus we must have\n\n\\[\nf(x) \\le 0 \\text{ for all } x \\in \\mathbb{R}.\n\\]\n\nBy substituting $\\frac{x}{2}$ for $x$ and $f(y)$ for $y$ and using $f(f(y)) = 2f(y)$, we obtain\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned} & f(xf(y)) + f(y)f\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right) = xf(y) + f\\left(\\frac{x}{2}f(y)\\right) \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\quad & xf(y) - f(xf(y)) = f\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)f(y) - f\\left(\\frac{x}{2}f(y)\\right) \\\\ & \\ge 0, \\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nwhere the last line of the above is true because the values of $f$ are non-positive. Combining this with condition (2) we find that\n\n\\[\nyf(x) \\ge f(xy)\n\\]\n\nIf we set $x > 0$ and $y = \\frac{1}{x}$ in the above inequality and use the fact that $f(1) = 0$, we find that $f(x) \\ge 0$. Also by putting $x = 0$ and $y = 2$ into the above inequality we find that $f(0) \\ge 0$. However, since $f(x) \\le 0$ for all $x$, we conclude that\n\n\\[\nf(x) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } x \\ge 0.\n\\]\n\nIf $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, then clearly this function is one solution to the problem.\n\nIf, on the other hand, there exists $b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(b) \\ne 0$, then by our conclusions above we have $b < 0$ and $f(b) < 0$. Next put $c = f(b)$ to find $f(c) = f(f(b)) = 2f(b) = 2c$. Then for any $x < 0$, we have $cx > 0$ and $2cx > 0$ so that $f(cx) = f(2cx) = 0$. Finally, substitute $y = c$ into condition (2) to find\n\n\\[\nf(2cx) + cf(x) = 2cx + f(cx),\n\\]\n\nfrom which it follows that $f(x) = 2x$ for any negative real number $x$.\n\nHence we have found that the function\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{if } x \\ge 0 \\\\ 2x & \\text{if } x < 0 \\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nis the only other potential solution to the problem. Since it is very non-obvious as to whether or not this is a solution, a check is absolutely vital.\n\nThis function satisfies condition (1) because $f(x) \\le 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nWe check the satisfaction of condition (2) by separating into 4 cases depending on whether $x$ or $y$ are negative or not.\n\n* For $x, y \\ge 0$, both sides of (2) are 0.\n\n* For $x \\ge 0$ and $y < 0$, we have $xy \\le 0$ and both sides of (2) are equal to $4xy$.\n\n* For $x < 0$ and $y \\ge 0$, we have $xy \\le 0$ and both sides of (2) are equal to $2xy$.\n\n* For $x, y < 0$, we have $xy > 0$ and both sides of (2) are $2xy$."

Hence we have\n\n$$\nx(a_1 + a_2) = 3(a_1 + a_3) = 2(a_2 + a_3).\n$$\n\nThen $3(a_1 + a_3) = 2(a_2 + a_3)$ yields\n\n$$\na_3 = 2a_2 - 3a_1.\n$$\n\nSubstitute this into $x(a_1 + a_2) = 2(a_2 + a_3)$ to find\n\n$$\nx(a_1 + a_2) = 6(a_2 - a_1) < 6(a_2 + a_1).\n$$\n\nHence $x < 6$. However, since $x \\geq 4$, this implies that $x = 4$ or $x = 5$.\n\nIf $x = 4$ then $4(a_1 + a_2) = 6(a_2 - a_1)$ from which $a_2 = 5a_1$. Then also $a_3 = 2a_2 - 3a_1 = 7a_1$ and $a_4 = a_2 + a_3 - a_1 = 11a_1$.\n\nIf $x = 5$ a similar procedure yields $a_2 = 11a_1$, $a_3 = 19a_1$ and $a_4 = 29a_1$.\n\nThus the set of solutions to $n_A = 4$ is given by $A = \\{t, 5t, 7t, 117\\}$ or $A = \\{t, 11t, 19t, 29t\\}$. It is easy to verify that these work.",

If $U$ is on the negative side of $\\ell$, then as the windmill proceeds, $\\ell$ passes through both $T$ and $U$. Then, because $U$ is the new pivot, as the windmill continues $T$ is now on the negative side of $\\ell$. Thus the negative side of $\\ell$ has lost the single point $U$, but gained the single point $T$. Hence the number of points on the negative side of $\\ell$ stays the same, and thus the number of points on the positive side of $\\ell$ also stays the same. A similar argument holds if $U$ is on the positive side of $\\ell$.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Australian_Scene_2011_p145_data_6a19a38eb1.png)\n\n**Lemma 3.** If the oriented line $\\ell$ is a halving line for its initial pivot, then $\\ell$ will always be a halving line for any later pivot.\n\n*Proof.* This is an immediate consequence of lemma 2.\n\nBack to the problem. We claim that the windmill defined by an arbitrary point $P$ and an oriented halving line $\\ell$ through $P$ visits every point in $S$ as a pivot infinitely many times. To prove this let $X$ be any point in $S$. From lemma 1 there exists an oriented halving line, $\\mu$ say, through $X$. If $\\mu$ is unlucky enough to be parallel to any line joining two other points of $S$, perturb $\\mu$ slightly by rotating it about $X$ by a tiny amount so that $\\mu$ is still a halving line but is no longer parallel to any of these other lines. Now as the oriented line $\\ell$ continues to rotate, it finds itself parallel to $\\mu$ and in the same orientation as $\\mu$ infinitely often. Note that at this point we have arranged it so that $\\ell$ passes through a single point, $Y$ say, of $S$. If $Y \\neq X$, then it is not possible for both $\\ell$ and $\\mu$ to be halving lines. This is because a parallel translation of an oriented line would disturb the halving property. But this is in contradiction to lemma 3.\n\nThus $Y = X$ and so the point $X$ is visited infinitely often.",

      "statement_latex": "Let $S$ contain $m$ points.\n\nWe define the notion of an oriented line $\\ell$ as well as the positive and negative side of an oriented line. An oriented line is an ordinary line along with a given orientation. The orientation is in the direction of a fixed vector which is parallel to the line. Note that a line has only two possible orientations. Furthermore, the line divides the plane into two half planes. If $A$ and $B$ are two different points on the line, and ray $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ is pointing in the direction of the orientation of the line, then rotation of the ray $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ anticlockwise $180^\\circ$ about $A$ sweeps out a half plane. This half plane is said to be the *positive* side of the oriented line $\\ell$. The other side is called the *negative* side of $\\ell$.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Australian_Scene_2011_p144_data_9af1140bcd.png)\n\n**Lemma 1.** For any point $P \\in S$ there exists an oriented line $\\ell$ through $P$ which contains no other point of $S$ and divides the remaining $m-1$ points of $S$ as closely into to halves as possible. Specifically, if $m = 2n + 1$ is odd, there are exactly $n$ points on each side of $\\ell$. But if $m = 2n$ is even, there are exactly $n$ points on the positive side of $\\ell$ and $n-1$ points on the negative side of $\\ell$. (We shall call such an oriented line a *halving* oriented line.)\n\n*Proof.* We cover both cases $m = 2n+1$ and $m = 2n$ simultaneously. Suppose we rotate the oriented line $\\ell$ by $180^\\circ$ slowly about $P$ and at the same time letting the positive and negative half planes rotate with $\\ell$. (Note that this is an ordinary rotation, not a windmill process.) For any angle $\\theta$ of partial rotation ($0 \\le \\theta \\le 180^\\circ$), let $f(\\theta)$ be the number of points of $S$ lying on the positive side of $\\ell$. If $f(0^\\circ) = n$ then we are done. Otherwise we may suppose without loss of generality that $f(0^\\circ) = n+r$ where $r$ is an integer. If $r > 0$ then $f(180^\\circ) = m - 1 - n - r < n$ because all the points on the negative side of $\\ell$ at the beginning are now on the positive side of $\\ell$ at the end. Note also that the value of $f$ is always a positive integer and that it changes by at most 1 as the line rotates. Since $f(0^\\circ) > n$ and $f(180^\\circ) < n$, by the Discrete Intermediate Value Theorem (DIVT) there is a value of $\\theta$ such that $f(\\theta) = n$. Hence there is a stage where the oriented line $\\ell$ has become a halving line. A similar argument using the DIVT holds for the case $r < 0$ because in this case $f(0^\\circ) < n$ and $f(180^\\circ) = m - 1 - n - r \\ge n$."

Thus the total number of ways of placing $i$ weights after $w_n$ and $n - (i + 1)$ weights before $w_n$ is equal to\n\n$$\nA_{n-(i+1)} \\cdot 2^i \\cdot \\frac{(n-1)!}{(n-(i+1))!}\n$$\n\nSince $i$ may be any integer in the range $0 \\le i \\le n-1$, we have the following formula which we manipulate.\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nA_n &= \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} A_{n-(i+1)} \\cdot 2^i \\cdot \\frac{(n-1)!}{(n-(i+1))!} \\\\\n&= A_{n-1} + \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} A_{n-(i+1)} \\cdot 2^i \\cdot \\frac{(n-1)!}{(n-(i+1))!} \\\\\n&= A_{n-1} + 2(n-1) \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} A_{n-(i+1)} \\cdot 2^{i-1} \\cdot \\frac{(n-2)!}{(n-(i+1))!} \\\\\n&= A_{n-1} + 2(n-1) \\sum_{j=0}^{n-2} A_{n-1-(j+1)} \\cdot 2^j \\cdot \\frac{(n-2)!}{(n-1-(j+1))!} \\\\\n&= A_{n-1} + 2(n-1)A_{n-1}.\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThus we have $A_n = (2n-1)A_{n-1}$ (*).\n\nWe claim that $A_n = (2n-1)(2n-3)\\dots\\cdot 3 \\cdot 1$. We prove this by induction.\n\nThe base step $A_1 = 1$ is true because a single weight must go on the left balance.\n\nFor the inductive step we have $A_{n+1} = (2n+1)A_n$ from (*). Then, using the inductive assumption we derive $A_{n+1} = (2n+1)(2n-1)(2n-3)\\dots\\cdot 3 \\cdot 1$, as desired. This concludes the induction and the proof."

Colin was a Bronze medalist with the 2011 Australian IMO Team.)\n\nAs in the first alternative we prove that $f$ is an even function, that is, $f(x) = f(-x)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $f(x)|f(0)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Thus $f$ is bounded.\n\nAssume for the sake of contradiction that it is possible to find $a, b$ in the range of $f$ with $a < b$ but $a \\nmid b$. Since $0 < a < b$ we also have $b \\nmid a$. Call such a pair $(a, b)$ exceptional. Since $f$ is bounded we may assume additionally that of all possible exceptional pairs, we have chosen one for which $a + b$ is maximal.\n\nLet $x, y$ be such that $f(x) = a$ and $f(y) = b$. Putting $m = y - x$ and $n = y$ into the original property yields $f(-x)|f(y-x) - f(y)$. Since $f$ is even this implies\n\n$$\na|c - b.\n$$\n\nSimilarly, we have\n\n$$\nb|c - a,\n$$\n\nwhere $c = f(y - x) = f(x - y)$.\n\nSince $a \\nmid b$ then from $a|c - b$, we must have also $a \\nmid c$. Similarly, since $b \\nmid a$ then from $b|c - a$, we must also have $b \\nmid c$. Thus $c \\neq a, b$\n\nIf $c > b$ were true, then also $c > a$ from $b > a$. But then we would have $c$ is in the range of $f$ with $b < c$ and with $b \\nmid c$. However, since $b + c > a + b$, this would contradict the maximality of $a + b$.\n\nIf $c < a$ were true, then from $b|c - a$ we would have $b|a - c$, so that $b < a$, a contradiction.\n\nThe final possibility is if $a < c < b$ were true. Then from $b|c - a$ we would have $b < c < b$, a contradiction.\n\nHence our assumption always leads to a contradiction. Thus there are no exceptional pairs, as required.",
