If $G$ is not connected then adding a new edge which connects two components does not give a new 3-clique, a contradiction.\n\nTherefore $G$ is connected and it has at least $n-1$ edges. On the other hand, the graph $K_{1,n-1}$ has the required property. ($K_{m,n}$ is the graph with $m+n$ vertices which are divided into two sets of $m$ and $n$ elements, respectively, and two vertices are adjacent if and only if they belong to different sets; the edges are obviously $mn$.) Thus the answer is $n-1$.\n\nb) Consider a graph with vertices $u_1, u_2, v_1, \\dots, v_{n-2}$ and edges all pairs $u_i v_j$, $i = 1, 2, j = 1, \\dots, n-2$, together with $u_1 u_2$. This graph has $n$ vertices, $2n-3$ edges and adding any new edge increases the number of the 4-cliques. Hence the required minimum number does not exceed $2n-3$.\n\nWe shall prove by induction on $n$ that the minimum possible number of edges is $2n-3$ and it is attained only for a graph as above. The assertion is obvious for $n=4$.\n\nAssume that the assertion is proved for graphs with $n-1$ or less vertices. Let $G$ be a graph with the required property having $n \\ge 5$, vertices and minimum possible number of edges.\n\nSince adding of a new edge increases the number of the 4-cliques, the graph $G$ has four vertices $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$ which determine exactly five edges joining them. Next we assume that the missing edge is $x_1x_2$. Let $G^*$ be the graph which is obtained from $G$ by cluing the vertices $x_1$ and $x_2$ (i.e. we remove $x_1$ and $x_2$ from $G$, add a new vertex $u$ and save all remaining vertices; the new vertex is adjacent exactly to these vertices which were adjacent to at least one of $x_1$ and $x_2$, all old edges are saved). Then\n\n$$\ne(G^*) \\leq e(G) - 2 \\leq 2n - 5 = 2(n - 1) - 3.\n$$\n\nHence the graph $G^*$ has $n-1$ vertices, possesses the required property and has at most $2(n-1)-3$ edges. Then the induction hypothesis implies that $G^*$ has exactly $2n-5$ edges and it has the structure described above – two vertices of degree $n-2$ and all remaining of degree 2. At least one of the vertices of degree $n-2$ is $x_3$ or $x_4$, say $x_3$. Then the degree of $x_3$ in $G$ is $n-1$.\n\nDenote by $G'$ the graph obtained from $G$ by removing the vertex $x_3$ and all edges from it. The graph $G'$ has at most $n-2$ edges since $G$ has at most $2n-3$ edges. Moreover, $G'$ has the property considered in a). Therefore it follows from the solution of a) that $G' = K_{1,n-2}$. It is easy to see now that $G$ has the required structure and this completes the induction step.\n\n*Remark.* The following more general assertion is true: The minimum possible edges of a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices such that adding an arbitrary new edge leads to appearance of a new $r$-clique is\n\n$$\ne(G) = \\binom{r-2}{2} + (n-r+2)(r-2).\n$$\n\nMoreover, the optimal graph is $G = K_{r-2}+E_{n-r+2}$, where $K_{r-2}$ is the complete graph with $r-2$ vertices and $E_{n-r+2}$ is the graph with $n-r+2$ vertices and without edges. (If $G_1 = (V_1, E_1)$ and $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ are two graphs then $G_1+G_2$ is the graph with vertices $V_1 \\cup V_2$ and edges $E_1 \\cup E_2 \\cup V_1 \\times V_2$.)",

Next we assume that the missing edge is $x_1x_2$. Let $G^*$ be the graph which is obtained from $G$ by cluing the vertices $x_1$ and $x_2$ (i.e. we remove $x_1$ and $x_2$ from $G$, add a new vertex $u$ and save all remaining vertices; the new vertex is adjacent exactly to these vertices which were adjacent to at least one of $x_1$ and $x_2$, all old edges are saved).

After the last cut we obtain two strips of lengths $2^{k_{l-1}}$ and $2^{k_l}$. Note that a strip whose length is a power of 2 can be cut into strips of length 1 without bad cuts.

Moreover the good cuts are done only over strips whose lengths are powers of 2. It is clear that rearranging the cuts we may assume that the first cuts are bad. Their number equals $g(n) - 1$ and each bad cut gives two new numbers on the table. Therefore after all bad cuts we have $2g(n) - 2$ distinct numbers. The powers of 2 that appear are all powers up to the highest power in the binary representation of $n$.\n\nThus, the number of distinct numbers on the table equals $2g(n)-2+k+1 = 2g(n)+k-1$, where $k$ is the highest power of 2 in the binary representation of $n$.",

Then the system can be written in the form\n\n\\[\n(1) \\qquad \\left| \\begin{array}{l} 3^{4\\alpha+1}a_1^4 + 3^{3\\beta}2b_1^3 = 3^{2\\gamma}c_1^2 \\\\ 3^{6\\alpha+1}a_1^6 + 3^{5\\beta}b_1^5 = 3^{2\\delta}d_1^2 \\end{array} \\right.\n\\]\n\nWe shall use the following trivial fact. If $3^k p + 3^l q = 3^m r$ and $3 \\nmid p, q, r$, then at least two of the numbers $k, l, m$ are equal. This and (1) imply that $4\\alpha + 1 = 3\\beta$ or $3\\beta = 2\\gamma$, and $6\\alpha + 1 = 5\\beta$ or $5\\beta = 2\\delta$. Then it is easy to see that $3\\beta = 2\\gamma$ and $5\\beta = 2\\delta$. Now (1) is equivalent to\n\n\\[\n\\left| \\begin{array}{l} 3^{4\\alpha+1-2\\gamma}a_1^4 + 2b_1^3 = c_1^2 \\\\ 3^{6\\alpha+1-2\\delta}a_1^6 + b_1^5 = d_1^2 \\end{array} \\right.\n\\]\n\nSince $4\\alpha + 1 - 2\\gamma > 0$ and $6\\alpha + 1 - 2\\delta > 0$, adding the last two equation, we conclude as above that $3|c_1, d_1$, a contradiction.",

If $a_i$ and $a_j$ are of the same parity they either do not change (if both are odd) or increase by 1 (if both are even). If $a_i$ and $a_j$ are of distinct parity then $a_j$ and $a_i + 2$ are also of distinct parity and thus, $a_j \\ge a_i + 2$ implies $a_j > a_i + 2$. Therefore if $a_j \\ge a_i + 2$ then after increasing all even digits by 1 the corresponding inequality is also true. Thus, we obtain 2007 natural numbers (some of them possibly equal) each of them with odd digits that satisfy the condition of the problem.\n\nWrite all the numbers in a table of 2007 rows and $n$ columns. Since every number in the first column is at least 3 we have that there is at least one digit greater than 3 in any of the remaining columns. Thus, there are no columns containing only digits 1 and 3. There are $5^{2007}$ possible columns consisting of 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and $2^{2007}$ possible columns consisting of digits 1 and 3. Therefore there are at most $1 + 5^{2007} - 2^{2007}$ columns, i.e. $n \\le 1 + 5^{2007} - 2^{2007}$.\n\nWe construct a table with $2007$ rows and $1 + 5^{2007} - 2^{2007}$ columns having the desired property in the following way:\n\n1. Write on the first row $5^{2006}$ digits 1, then $5^{2006}$ digits 3, ..., $5^{2006}$ digits 9. On the second row write under equal digits in the first row consecutively $5^{2005}$ digits 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and so on, down to the last row. Consider the rows $i$ and $j$ for which $i < j$. It is clear that if $a_i$ and $a_j$ are the first distinct digits (from up) in these columns then $a_j > a_i$, which implies that $a_j \\ge a_i + 2$. Therefore the table has $5^{2007}$ columns and satisfies (with exception that the numbers corresponding to the rows of the table lie in the interval $[2 \\cdot 10^{n-1}, 10^n)$) the desired property.\n\n2. Delete all columns consisting only of digits 1 and 3. The table now has $5^{2007} - 2^{2007}$ columns.\n\n3. Add a first column consisting only of digit 3.

If $(p, q, r)$ is a permutation of $(a, b, c)$, then it follows from the condition for the parallelepipeds $((0, 0, 0), p, q, r)$ and $((0, 0, 1), p, q, r)$ that the parallelepipeds $((0, 0, 0), p, q, 1)$ and $((0, 0, r), p, q, 1)$ are filled with cubes of the same colors. This implies that the parallelepipeds $((0, 0, 0), c, a, 1)$ and $((0, 0, b), c, a, 1)$ are also filled with cubes of the same colors and the same is true for the parallelepipeds $((0, 0, 0), c, b, 1)$ and $((0, 0, ma), c, b, 1)$. Since $((0, 0, 0), c, b, 1)$ contains $((0, 0, 0), c, a, 1)$ and $((0, 0, ma), c, b, a)$ contains $((0, 0, ma), c, b, 1)$ and $((0, 0, b), c, a, 1)$, every color in $((0, 0, 0), c, a, 1)$ appears at least two times in $((0, 0, ma), c, b, a)$. This contradiction completes the proof that $a$ divides $b$. We analogously see that $b$ divides $c$.\n\nNow let $a|b$ and $b|c$, as $b = p_1a, c = p_2b = p_1p_2a$, where $p_1, p_2 \\in \\mathbb{N}$.

Since $|x_1 - x_2|$, $|y_1 - y_2|$ and $|z_1 - z_2|$ are divisible to $a$, one of these numbers equals 0. Let us have $x_1 = x_2$. Then the fourth and fifth coordinates of that color show that $|y_1 - y_2|$ and $|z_1 - z_2|$ are divisible to $b$ and therefore one of these two numbers equals 0. If, for example, $y_1 = y_2$, then the last coordinate shows that $|z_1 - z_2|$ is divisible to $c$, i.e. $z_1 = z_2$.

Then the same argument as above gives $c_1 = c_2 = \\dots = c_n = c$. Hence $f(x) = x^2 + c$ and the equations are $(x^2+c)(x^2+c) = (x^2+c)^2+c$. Then $c = 0$ and $f_1(x) = f_2(x) = \\dots = f_n(x) = x^2$.",

We have to show that $A = \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nFirst, we shall prove that $D(X, 2r_X) \\subset A$. We may assume that $X = O$ and $r_0 = 1$.

For $n=0$, this follows from the given condition. Suppose that $A_k \\subset A$. It suffices to prove that $Y \\in A$ for $Y \\in [a_{k+1}, a_k) \\cup (b_k, b_{k+1}]$ and then apply rotation.

Without loss of generality assume that $A$ and $B$ are blue points and $C$ is a red point.\n\nWe proceed by induction on the number $n \\ge 0$ of inner points for the triangle.\nWhen $n = 0$ we draw a segment with end points $A$ and $B$ and we are done.\nAssume the assertion holds for any triangle with $n = k$ inner points. Consider\ntriangle with $n = k + 1$ inner points and let these points be colored in arbitrary\nmanner. If all points are blue then we connect $A$ with $B$ and with all inner points\nand the condition holds.\n\nIf there exists a red point $D$, we apply the induction hypothesis for triangles $ABD$, $BCD$ and $ACD$. It is clear that red points from distinct triangles are\nconnected through $D$, and the blue points from distinct triangles are connected\nthrough $A$ or $B$. This completes the proof of the lemma. $\\square$\n\nNote that for any good coloring all blue points of $M$ are consecutive vertices.\nIndeed, if this is not the case we have two red points $A$ and $B$, dividing the\ncontour of $M$ into two parts with two blue points $C$ and $D$ in each of these\nparts. It is clear now that the red path between $A$ and $B$ intersects the blue path\nbetween $C$ and $D$, a contradiction.\n\nLet us first count the number of good colorings of the vertexes of $M$. There\nexist two such colorings with all points having one and the same color. When both\ncolors occur let $k > 0$ be the number of blue points. For any $k = 1, 2, \\dots, 2010$\nthere exist 2011 ways of choosing the group of $k$ consecutive blue points. Therefore\nwe have $2011 \\cdot 2010 + 2$ ways of coloring the vertexes of $M$.\n\nWe show now that any coloring of the inner points is good. If all vertexes\nof $M$ have one and the same color (say blue) and all inner point are also blue\nwe connect one vertex with all remaining points. If there exists a red point $B$,\nthen we consider all triangles with one vertex $B$ and sides the sides of $M$. The\nassertion of the Lemma completes the proof in this case.\n\nConsider coloring of the vertexes of $M$ in which both blue and red points\noccur. Without loss of generality assume the blue points are $A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_k, k <\n2011$. Connect $A_1$ with all red points and $A_{k+1}$ with all blue points. Now $M$ is\npartitioned into triangles and each triangle has vertexes of both colors. Apply\nthe Lemma for each of these triangles. The points having one and the same color\nfrom distinct triangles are connected through $A_1$ or $A_{k+1}$ or by the sides of $M$.\n\nTherefore the number of good colorings equals $2^{2011}(2011 \\cdot 2010 + 2)$.",

We can assume, without loss of generality, that $p$ and $q$ have positive leading coefficients. Let $P_0 = p$ and $Q_0 = q$ and let $P_1(x) = xp(x) - (x^2 - 1)q(x)$ and $Q_1(x) = -p(x) + xq(x)$. It is easy to show that $P_1$ and $Q_1$ also satisfy the given equation and that the degree of $Q_1$ is strictly less than the degree of $Q_0$.\n\n(One way to come up with this construction is as follows. The equation on $p$ and $q$ can be rewritten as $1 = (p(x) - q(x)\\sqrt{x^2-1})(p(x) + q(x)\\sqrt{x^2-1})$. Also, one of its solutions is given by $(p, q) = (x, 1)$, i.e. $1 = (x - \\sqrt{x^2-1})(x + \\sqrt{x^2-1})$. Multiplying the last two equations then gives us exactly $1 = (P_1(x) - Q_1(x)\\sqrt{x^2-1})(P_1(x) + Q_1(x)\\sqrt{x^2-1})$.)\n\nContinuing this process, we will eventually arrive at a solution $(P_s, Q_s)$ such that $Q_s$ is constant. There are, however, only two solutions of this kind: $(x, 1)$ and $(1, 0)$. Since applying the operation to the former yields the latter, we can, without loss of generality, assume that $(P_s, Q_s) = (1, 0)$.\n\nIt follows that all solution pairs $(p, q)$ are given by the sequence determined by the initial condition $(p_0, q_0) = (1, 0)$ and the recurrence relation $(p_{i+1}, q_{i+1}) = (xp_i(x) + (x^2-1)q_i(x), p_i(x) + xq_i(x))$. (Or, more precisely, this recurrence yields those solutions in which the leading coefficients of $p$ and $q$ are positive.)\n\nA member of that sequence corresponds to a solution of the original equation exactly when $p(x)$ is congruent to $1 \\pmod{2x}$ and $q(x)$ is divisible by $2x$. Since the first five members of the sequence are $(1, 0)$, $(x, 1)$, $(2x^2 - 1, 2x)$, $(4x^3 - 3x, 4x^2 - 1)$, and $(8x^4 - 8x^2 + 1, 8x^3 - 4x)$ and $(p_4(x), q_4(x)) \\equiv (1, 0) \\pmod{2x}$, the sequence is periodic with period $4 \\pmod{2x}$ and exactly the members $(p_i, q_i)$ such that $i$ is a multiple of $4$ yield a solution. Therefore, the necessary values of $n$ are the numbers $4k + 3$ for $k \\ge 0$.",

We want to characterize all pairs $(p, q)$ that can be obtained in this way. Note that if $(p, q) = 1$, then from (3) follows $(p', q') = 1$. Let us prove that the set of pairs $(p, q)$ in question is\n\n$$\nA := \\{(p, q) : p, q \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{0\\}, |p| < |q|, (p, q) = 1, \\text{ one of } p, q \\text{ is even, the other is odd.}\\}\n$$\n\nNote that we ruled out $|p| = |q|$ because $\\frac{p}{q} = \\pm 1$ cannot be represented as wanted. The transformation described in (3) shows that we cannot step outside $A$. To prove that all pairs in $A$ can be generated, we follow a standard procedure - take $(p', q') \\in A$ and search for $(p, q) \\in A$ that generates $(p', q')$ via (3), but we want $(p, q)$ be \"less\"than $(p', q')$. That's how induction works. Solving (3) with respect to $(p, q)$ yields\n\n$$\np = q' - 2\\ell p'; \\quad q = p' \\quad (4)\n$$\n\nClearly, we can choose $\\ell \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $|q' - 2\\ell p'| < |p'|$ (since $p' \\neq 0$). Indeed, consider the points $q' - 2\\ell p'$ where $\\ell$ runs through all integers. These points are at a distance $2p'$ apart, and none of them hits $p'$ because $(p', q') = 1$. Hence, the point closest to 0 has magnitude less than $p'$. So, we started from $(p', q') \\in A$, and found $(p, q) \\in A$ that generates $(p', q')$ and moreover, $q = p', |p| < |p'| < |q'|$. Apparently $(p, q)$ is \"less\"than $(p', q')$, that is, $|p| < |p'|, |q| < |q'|$. Now, induction does the job. Obviously, $(1, 2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (-1, -2)$ can be represented as continued fractions satisfying the statement. Assume that all $(p, q) \\in A$ with $|p| \\le N, |q| \\le N$ can be represented like that. Take $(p', q') \\in A, |q'| = N + 1$. As just shown, there exists $(p, q) \\in A, |p| < |q| \\le N$ such that\n\n$$\n\\frac{p'}{q'} = \\frac{1}{2\\ell + \\frac{p}{q}}.\n$$\n\nThe induction step is complete and the result follows. Note that it also follows that the representation of numbers in $A$ as continued fractions like that is unique. Indeed, take a pair $(p', q') \\in A$. The pair $(p, q) \\in A$ that satisfies (4) and $|p| < |p'|$ is determined uniquely. Uniqueness follows easily.\n\n\\textbf{Remark.} The main difficulty in my opinion is that the answer wasn't told to the students. The result could have been much better otherwise. Some motivation about guessing the answer can be found in this blog $\\Box$",

          "latex": "There are at least $kmn$ edges colored in the most used color. We delete the remaining edges and prove that there exists a connected component with at least $m+n$ vertices in the remaining graph. The idea is to consider all the connected components. If each one has less than $m+n$ vertices, then the graph is too fragmented and it's impossible to have too many (at least $kmn$) edges even if all edges are present in every connected component. It boils down to prove a certain inequality.\n\n\\textbf{Lemma.} Let $x, y$ be two positive real numbers and $\\ell, k$; $\\ell \\ge k$ be natural numbers. Let $x_i, y_i, i = 1, 2, \\dots, \\ell$ satisfy the following conditions.\n\n$$\nx_i \\ge 0, y_i \\ge 0, x_i + y_i \\le (x+y)/k, i = 1, 2, \\dots, \\ell;\n$$\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{\\ell} x_i = x, \\quad \\sum_{i=1}^{\\ell} y_i = y. \\qquad (1)\n$$\n\nThen it holds\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{\\ell} x_i y_i \\le \\frac{xy}{k}.\n$$\n\nThe equality is reached only if $x_i = x/k, y_i = y/k, i = 1, 2, \\dots, k$; $x_i = y_i = 0, i > k$.\n\n\\textbf{Proof.} Let us denote $f(x, y) := \\sum_{i=1}^{\\ell} x_i y_i$, where $x = (x_1, \\dots, x_{\\ell})$, $y = (y_1, \\dots, y_{\\ell})$. The conditions in (1) determine a compact set, hence $f$ attains its maximum value on it, say, at the points $x'_i, y'_i, i = 1, 2, \\dots, \\ell$. We can assume $x'_1 \\ge x'_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge x'_{\\ell}$. We shall prove that $y'_i$ are also in decreasing order. Let us assume on the contrary that $y'_i < y'_{i+1}$. Set\n\n$$\nx_i = x_{i+1} := (x'_i + x'_{i+1})/2; \\quad y_i = y_{i+1} := (y'_i + y'_{i+1})/2.\n$$\n\nThen (Chebyshev inequality)\n\n$$\nx_i y_i + x_{i+1} y_{i+1} > x'_i y'_i + x'_{i+1} y'_{i+1}.\n$$\n\nBut it contradicts the maximality of $x'_i, y'_i, i = 1, \\dots, \\ell$. Next, if $x'_1 + y'_1 < (x+y)/k$ we can similarly set $x_1 := x'_1 + \\varepsilon, x_2 := x'_2 - \\varepsilon; y_1 := y'_1 + \\delta, x_2 := x'_2 - \\delta$ for sufficiently small $\\varepsilon, \\delta \\ge 0$ and get a larger value of $f$. Therefore, $x'_1 + y'_1 = (x+y)/k$.\n\nLet $k'$ be the largest index for which $x_{k'} > 0$ and $y_{k'} > 0$. In the same way we can see that $x'_i + y'_i = (x+y)/k, i = 1, 2, \\dots, k'$. Hence, $k' \\le k$. Assume that $k' < k$ and $y_i = 0, i > k'$. We modify $x', y'$ as follows. Set\n\n$$\nx_i := x'_i, y_i := y'_i, i = 1, 2, \\dots, k' - 1; \\\\ x_{k'} := x'_{k'}, y_{k'} := y'_{k'} - \\varepsilon, x_{k'+1} := (x+y)/k, y_{k'+1} := \\varepsilon.\n$$\n\nFor $i > k' + 1$ we set $y_i = 0$, and the values of $x_i, i > k' + 1$ are irrelevant providing they comply with (1). Since $x'_k < (x+y)/k$, it can be seen that $f(x, y) > f(x', y')$ which contradicts the maximality of $x', y'$.\n\nThus, $k' = k$. We prove that $x'_i = x/k, y'_i = y/k, i = 1, 2, \\dots, k$. Assume on the contrary it doesn't hold and let $j$ be the first index for which $x'_j \\ne x/k$. WLOG let $x'_j < x/k$. Then there exists $i > j$ for which $x'_i > x/k$. This means $x'_i > x'_j$ and thus the sequence $x'_1, x'_2, \\dots, x'_k$ is not decreasing, contradiction. To recap, we established that $x'_i = x/k, y'_i = y/k, i = 1, 2, \\dots, k$. In this case $f(x', y') = kxy$, and Lemma 1 is proved. $\\square$\n\nBack to the problem. The number of all edges of $K$ is $k^2mn$, hence there is a color, say, white such that at least $kmn$ edges are colored white. We delete all edges colored in a color other than white. We'll prove that in the remaining graph $K'$, there exists a connected component with at least $m+n$ vertices. Assume on the contrary it is not true. Denote the connected components of $K'$ by $G(A_i, B_i)$, $i = 1, 2, \\dots, \\ell$ and let $|A_i| = m_i, |B_i| = n_i, i = 1, 2, \\dots, \\ell$. We have\n\n$$\n\\sum i = 1^\\ell m_i = km, \\quad \\sum_{i=1}^\\ell n_i = kn, m_i + n_i < m + n.\n$$\n\nAccording to Lemma 1,\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{\\ell} m_i n_i < kmn\n$$\n\nwhich contradicts the choice of the white color. This means that for at least one index $i$ it holds $m_i + n_i \\ge m + n$.\n\n\\textbf{Remark.} More comments can be found in this blog. This problem allows a generalization as described here. $\\Box$",

Fix some $d, d < 1$, it may be very close to 1. Take an equilateral triangle with side length 1 and put inside it $3n$ points - $n$ points near each of its vertices so that they be at distance less than $(1 - d)/2$ from the corresponding vertex - fig 1. This set of points apparently is a good set. A disk with radius $d$ cannot cover a point that is near to one vertex and a point near another vertex. That is, the maximum number of points that could be covered with such a disk is $n$. This means that $m(n, d) \\le n$ no matter how close to 1 the value of $d$ is.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/bulgarian_math_competitions_2023-2024_p13_data_90a8bf2a62.png)\n\nWe will prove that $m(n, d) = n$ when $d$ is close to 1. To prove this we need to study the good set of points. How close together are its points? Can we claim that all of them lie in disk with some not too large radius? Of course, they lie in a disk with radius 1 since if you take one of the points, the rest are at distance at most 1 from this point. But can we claim that all of them lie in a disk with a smaller radius? Clearly, they may not lie in a disk with radius $1/2$ - the equilateral triangle with side length 1 is an example that disproves this. Crucial to this problem is the following observation.\n\n\\textbf{Lemma.} Any good set can be put inside a disk with radius $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$. That is, any good set can be put inside a circle circumscribed about an equilateral triangle with a side length 1.\n\nThe official solution proves it by using Helly's theorem which is instructive. Another method is used here.\n\n\\textbf{Proof.} Let $X$ be a good set. We first show that $X$ lies in a circle circumscribed about an acute triangle with side lengths less or equal to 1. Take the convex hull of $X$ and put it inside a circle with some radius. We begin to tighten this circle until it touches 1 and then 2 points of the convex hull. We can tighten the circle further unless these two points lie on its diameter. In this case $A$ lies in a circle with a diameter at most 1. So, assume we decrease the circle $k$ until it touches 3 points of $X$, say $A, B, C$. If these points are vertices of an acute triangle we done, so suppose $\\angle ACB \\ge 90^\\circ$ see fig.2. We begin to further decrease the diameter of $k$ keeping the points $A$ and $B$ on the circle. This can be done until the first of the following two events happens:\n\n1. The circle hits a point $C' \\in X$ (and $C'$ and $C$ lie on different sides of $AB$).\n\n2. $AB$ becomes a diameter of $k$.\n\nIf the second event happens first, we are done since $X$ lies in a disk with diameter 1. In case of the first event, the triangle $ABC'$ is acute. Next, since $\\triangle ABC'$ is acute one of its angles, say $\\angle AC'B$, is greater or equal to $60^\\circ$. It follows\n\nthe radius of $k' = \\frac{AB}{2 \\sin \\angle C} \\le \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nSo, we proved that we can cover $X$ with a circle $k$ with radius $1/\\sqrt{3}$. $\\square$\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/bulgarian_math_competitions_2023-2024_p14_data_8f52d3ba97.png)\n\nNow, let $X$ be a good set. We cover it with a disk $k$ of radius $1/\\sqrt{3}$ - the blues circle on fig 3. We prove that if $d$ is close enough to 1 (how close depends only on $n$ but not on $X$) we can cover $X$ with 3 disks with diameter $d$.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/bulgarian_math_competitions_2023-2024_p14_data_fc116456ae.png)\n\nTake a point $A \\in k$ and construct the points $B, C, D \\in k$ such that $AB = BC = CD = d$ - see fig 3. We construct three disks with diameters $AB, BC, CD$ correspondingly. These disks cover all the points inside $k$ except the red piece in fig 3. Note now that by taking $d$ close to 1, the point $D$ will be as close to $A$ as we want. This means that we can make the red piece on fig 3 as small as we want. We take $d$ so close to 1 so that the measure of the arc $AD$ (on fig. 3) is less than $\\frac{2\\pi}{3n+1}$. If the red piece does not contain a point of $X$ we are done. Otherwise we begin to rotate the point $A$ and the entire configuration around $k$. It is not possible that every time the red piece hits a point of $X$ since otherwise the number of points in $X$ would be more than $3n$. Therefore we can cover $X$ with 3 disks of diameter $d$, hence one of these disks contains at least $n$ points. Thus, we proved that $m(n,d) \\ge n$ and combined with $m(n,d) \\le n$ this yields",

Moreover, $y_1 > x_1$ and therefore $x_1^k y_1 > 1$. Therefore, to be $p$ it is simply necessary that $x_1 = 1$, $y_1 = p$ and $y_1^2 - x_1^2 = d^{k-1}$ are fulfilled at the same time.

          "latex": "Firstly, we will prove the following\n\nLemma: Let $G$ be a connected graph with at least 3 vertices. Then either there exist two vertices connected by an edge whose removal (along with the outgoing edges) leaves $G$ connected, or there exist two vertices of degree 1 (i.e., “leaves”).\n\nConsider an arbitrary “covering tree” of $G$ and take as its “root” an arbitrary vertex that is not a “leaf”. Let $v$ be the farthest vertex from the “root” and $u$ be its “ancestor”. Let $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_k$ be the “successors” of $u$. Clearly, they are all leaves on the tree.\n\n*Case 1.* Among $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_k$ there are two vertices connected by an edge in $G$. Then removing these two vertices leaves the tree (and therefore $G$) connected.\n\n*Case 2.* Among $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_k$ there are two vertices that are leaves in $G$. Then there are indeed at least two leaves in the output graph.\n\n*Case 3.* Among $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_k$ there is at most one vertex that is a leaf in $G$ (b.o.o., let it be $v_1$). Then let us “connect” each of $v_2, \\dots, v_k$ to an arbitrary vertex in $G$ other than $u$ (such vertices exist, and none of these “connecting” edges are part of the covering tree, due to the extreme choice of $u$, i.e., each of them is part of a loop, all remaining edges of which are from the covering tree). Now we can remove $u$ and $v_1$ and we will have a spanning tree again, so $G$ remains connected.\n\nThis proves the lemma. With its help we can easily prove the following\nAssertion: Let $G$ be a connected graph with $n \\ge 2$ vertices. Then we can color its vertices in two colors, so that if $x$ and $y$ are the number of “multicolored” and “single colored” edges, respectively, then $x - y \\ge \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor$.\n\nProof: For $n = 2, 3$ the statement is immediately verified. Let $n \\ge 4$ and $G$ be a connected graph with $n$ vertices. Let $u$ and $v$ be the two vertices from the Lemma. We “remove” $u$ and $v$ and color $G \\setminus \\{u, v\\}$ according to the induction hypothesis. Now, it is not difficult to see that we can color $u \\cup v$ such that the difference under consideration increases by at least 1. Indeed, this is clear if $u$ and $v$ are leaves, and otherwise case, considering the parity of the number of neighbors of $u \\cup v$ in $G \\setminus \\{u, v\\}$, we see that there is always such a way. The statement is proved by induction.\n\nLet us now consider an arbitrary connected graph $G$ with $n \\ge 3$ vertices and $m$ edges. We “color” it according to the Assertion: we have $x - y \\ge \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor$; $x + y = m$, therefore\n\n\\[\ny \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\left( m - \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor \\right)\n\\]\n\nand deleting $y$ edges satisfies the condition. Thus, we got $k \\le \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nTo show that $k \\ge \\frac{1}{2}$ let us consider the complete graph with $n$ vertices. A necessary and sufficient condition for having the coloring from the condition is that the graph obtained after deleting the edges is bipartite. Indeed, there must be no cycles of odd length in the graph, which is equivalent to the above.\n\nCase 1. $n = 2n_1$, $n_1 \\ge 2$. Then $m = \\binom{n}{2}$. To reach a bipartite graph, we need to delete all the edges in each of the two groups of vertices, and the number of deleted edges is minimal when the two groups are of equal power and contain $n_1$ vertices. So, we need to delete at least\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n_1}{2} + \\binom{n_1}{2} = n_1^2 - n_1\n\\]\n\nedges. From here\n\n\\[\nn_1^2 - n_1 \\le k \\cdot \\left( \\binom{2n_1}{2} - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2n_1}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\right) = k \\cdot \\left( \\frac{2n_1(2n_1-1)}{2} - n_1 \\right) \\implies k \\ge \\frac{1}{2}.\n\\]\n\nCase 2. $n = 2n_1 + 1$, $n_1 \\ge 1$. Similarly, here we need to delete at least\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n_1 + 1}{2} + \\binom{n_1}{2} = n_1^2\n\\]\n\nedges and again\n\n\\[\nn_1^2 \\le k \\cdot \\left( \\binom{2n_1 + 1}{2} - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2n_1 + 1}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\right) = k \\cdot \\left( \\frac{2n_1(2n_1 + 1)}{2} - n_1 \\right) \\implies k \\ge \\frac{1}{2}.\n\\]",

Therefore, we can consider that $k = 3$.\n\nSuppose that the statement is not true for a graph $G$, as we can choose $G$ to have a minimal number of vertices. It follows from the minimality of $G$ that after removing any vertex, the new graph will not be connected by any of the colors, and let it be color 1. Denote by $G_1, G_2, \\dots, G_t$ the color connectivity components 1 after deleting vertex $A$. Since $G$ is color 1 connected, there exist $A_i \\in G_i$ for which $AA_i$ is color 1. The segment $A_1A_2$ is not color 1 because $G_1$ and $G_2$ are different components of connectivity. Let it be of color 2. If $A_1B$ is a color 1 segment of $G_1$, then the segment $A_2B$ cannot be of color 1 because $G_1$ and $G_2$ are different connectivity components; cannot be of color 3, because then $A_1A_2B$ is a multicolor triangle and is therefore of color 2. Analogously, it is proved that all segments between the points of $G_1$ and $G_2$ are of color 2. We obtained that all segments between any two connectivity components are either color 2 or color 3.\n\nNow consider segments $AX$ and $AY$ in colors 2 and 3, respectively (such segments exist, since $G$ is connected in each of the colors). Without limitation, we have the following two cases:\n\n1. $X, Y \\in G_1$, then one of the triangles $AXA_2$ and $AYA_2$ is multicolored.\n\n2. $X \\in G_1$ and $Y \\in G_2$, then one of the triangles $AXA_2$ and $AYA_1$ is multicolored.\n\nThe resulting contradiction shows that for every graph with the given properties there exists a multicolored triangle. \\(\\Box\\)",

We have that $|M| > p$, i.e. in $M$ there are two distinct elements $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$, for which $ax_1 + by_1 + cz_1 \\equiv ax_2 + by_2 + cz_2 \\pmod p$. Thus $(x_1 - x_2, y_1 - y_2, z_1 - z_2)$ satisfies the conditions of the lemma.\n\nNow let $p \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$. Then the comparison $x^3 \\equiv 2 \\pmod p$ has a solution $a$, since the function $x \\mapsto x^3$ is injective in $\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$, hence it is surjective. One way to verify this is to see that $x^3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$ has only 1 for a solution, since $(3, p-1) = 1$ and hence the exponent of $x \\pmod p$ is 1.\n\nFrom the lemma, there exist $x, y, z$ with $|x|, |y|, |z| < \\sqrt[3]{p}$, for which $x+ay+a^2z \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$. From here we get that $x^3+a^3y^3+a^6z^3-3a^3xyz \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$. The latter is equivalent to $x^3+2y^3+4z^3-6xyz \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$. On the other hand $|x|, |y|, |z| < \\sqrt[3]{p}$ gives $|x^3+2y^3+4z^3-6xyz| < 13p$. Also notice that if $x^3+2y^3+4z^3-6xyz < 0$, then the triple $(-x, -y, -z)$ will give a natural number divisible by $p$.\n\nIt remains to note that $x^3+2y^3+4z^3-6xyz \\neq 0$. Indeed, if $x^3+2y^3+4z^3-6xyz = 0$, then we have $(x+\\sqrt[3]{2}y+\\sqrt[3]{4}z)((x-\\sqrt[3]{2}y)^2+(x-\\sqrt[3]{4}z)^2+(\\sqrt[3]{2}y-\\sqrt[3]{4}z)^2) = 0$, i.e. $x = \\sqrt[3]{2}y = \\sqrt[3]{4}z$ or $x+y\\sqrt[3]{2}+z\\sqrt[3]{4} = 0$, whose only integer solutions are $(x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0)$ (the first follows because $\\sqrt[3]{2}$ is irrational, and the second follows from the fact that $x^3 - 2$ is the minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt[3]{2}$ over the rational numbers). \\Box",

Without restriction, let $A_1 = 1$ and consider all segments $A_iA_{i+1}$ for $i = 1, 2, ..., 1012$. Since $A_{1013} = -1$, among the considered segments there is an odd number whose ends are one positive and one negative number. These two numbers can be $\\{-1, 2\\}$ or $\\{1, -2\\}$ and let the number of segments with ends of the first kind be $p$ and the number of segments with ends of the second species to be $q$. Due to symmetry, the number of segments $A_iA_{i+1}$ for $i = 1013, ..., 2024$ ($A_{2025} \\equiv A_1$) with ends $\\{1, -2\\}$ is equal to $p$. Therefore, all segments with endpoints $\\{1, -2\\}$ are $p+q$, which is an odd number.\n\nNow consider any triangle that does not have two vertices with opposite numbers. We have the following possibilities for the three numbers:\n\n$$\n(1, 1, -2), (1, 1, 2), (-1, -1, 2), (-1, -1, -2), \\\\ (2, 2, -1), (2, 2, 1), (-2, -2, 1), (-2, -2, -1).\n$$\n\nEach of these triangles has an even number (2 or 0) of sides with ends 1 and $-2$. Therefore, the total number of segments with ends 1 and $-2$ (counted in multiples) is an even number. But every line segment inside the 2024-gon is counted twice (once from the two triangles in which it participates), and every line segment that is a side of the 2024-gon is counted once. The resulting contradiction shows that a triangle with the requested property exists. $\\square$",

Since it is not a complete system of residues modulo 2024, it means that the set of all favourite numbers consists of less than 2024 numbers. Take now 2024 cities and connect every two of them with a road. This is an example for which (i) can hold if all colours (favourite numbers) are used.

Indeed, if $f_1(u) = f_1(v)$ for some connected vertices $u \\in W, v \\in V \\setminus W$, it implies $f(u) = f(v) + m$ and thus, we would reach $v$ from $v$ from $u$ under the mapping $f$, which contradicts the maximality of $W$.\n\nTherefore, the mapping $f_1$ satisfies (i), and moreover starting from $v_0$ we\ncan reach any vertex in $W$. Since $W$ is maximal, it's not possible to access any\nvertex outside $W$. It allows us to change the assignment of favourite numbers\nagain using the rule\n\n$$\nf_2(v) = f_1(v) - m \\pmod{2024}, \\forall v \\in V \\setminus W\n$$\n\nand so on.

It can be seen that $T$ is a fully balanced binary tree - see fig. 1. We label each vertex with the knight's number in the first list. Let us assume the vertices can be arranged in a row $i_1, i_2, \\dots, i_m$ as King Arthur requested, where $m = 2^n - 1$ and $i_j$ refers to the label of the corresponding vertex. There is a unique path in $T$, $i_1 = v_1v_2\\dots v_\\ell = i_m$ that connects the vertex labeled as $i_1$ and $i_m$. Clearly, $\\ell \\le 2(n-1)+1$, because the longest path in $T$ has length $2(n-1)$. Note that the distance between the positions of $v_i$ and $v_{i+1}$ in the new list, is at most $k$. This means that $(\\ell-1)k \\ge m-1$ which yields\n\n$$\nk \\ge \\frac{2^n - 2}{2n - 2} > \\frac{2^n}{4n},\n$$\n\nwhich proves the lower bound for $k$.\n\nNow we will arrange the vertices of $T$ in a list. Let $\\ell$ be a natural number which will be determined later. Denote by $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_s, s := 2^\\ell$ the vertices of $T$ on the $\\ell$-th level, and let $T(v_1), T(v_2), \\dots, T(v_s)$ be the subtrees with roots in these points - see fig. 1. Each of them has exactly $2^{n-1-\\ell}$ leaves.\n\nWe successively put in a list the vertices of $T$ as follows. First, we place the last level of vertices of $T(v_1)$, that is, its leaves. Then we put down the second to last level of $T(v_1)$ and the last level of $T(v_2)$. At the $i$-th step we place the $i$-th level of $T(v_1)$, counting from the bottom up (fig. 1), then the $i-1$-th level of $T(v_2)$ (from the bottom up) and so on, and finally - the last layer of $T(v_i)$ (i.e. its leaves). The number of vertices we place at the $i$-th step $i = 1, 2, \\dots, s-\\ell-1$ is equal to\n\n$$\n\\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} 2^{n-1-\\ell-j} \\le 2^{n-\\ell}.\n$$\n\nWe follow these steps until one of the two events happens. 1) We reach the root $v_1$ of $T(v_1)$. 2) We place in the list the leaves of $T(v_s)$. The first event will\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/bulgarian_math_competitions_2023-2024_p45_data_164134b895.png)\n\nhappen after $n - \\ell$ steps and the second one - after $s = 2^\\ell$ steps. To ensure that the second event occurs first we choose $\\ell$ to be the largest positive integer for which $s = 2^\\ell \\le n - \\ell$.\n\nIn this situation, at the *s*-th step we have put the leaves of $T(v_s)$ in the list. On the *s* + 1-th step we put in the list the remaining vertices of *T*. The number of all vertices in $T(v_s)$ without its last level does not exceed $2^{n-\\ell-1}$. The number of vertices in $T(v_{s-1})$ without its last two layers does not exceed $2^{n-\\ell-2}$ and so on. Adding the vertices of *T* up to its *l*-th level, we obtain that the number of the vertices ordered at the last step is at most\n\n$$\n2 \\cdot 2^{\\ell} + 2^{n-\\ell} \\le 2 \\cdot 2^{n-\\ell} \\le 8 \\cdot \\frac{2^n}{n}\n$$\n\nsince $2^{n+2} \\ge n$. Clearly, for any vertex $v$, placed at position $j$ in the first $s$ steps, all of its neighbours in $T$, that are placed after it, are in positions with numbers not exceeding $j+2 \\cdot 2^{n-\\ell} \\le j+8 \\cdot \\frac{2^n}{n}$.

Solving (3) with respect to $(p, q)$ yields\n\n\\[\np = q' - 2\\ell p'; q = p' \\quad (4)\n\\]\n\nClearly, we can choose $\\ell \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $|q' - 2\\ell p'| < |p'|$ (since $p' \\neq 0$). Indeed, consider the points $q' - 2\\ell p'$ where $\\ell$ runs through all integers. These points are at a distance $2p'$ apart, and none of them hits $p'$ because $(p', q') = 1$. Hence, the point closest to 0 has magnitude less than $p'$. So, we started from $(p', q') \\in A$, and found $(p, q) \\in A$ that generates $(p', q')$ and moreover, $q = p', |p| < |p'| < |q'|$. Apparently $(p, q)$ is \"less\"than $(p', q')$, that is, $|p| < |p'|, |q| < |q'|$. Now, induction does the job. Obviously, $(1, 2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (-1, -2)$ can be represented as continued fractions satisfying the statement. Assume that all $(p, q) \\in A$ with $|p| \\le N, |q| \\le N$ can be represented like that. Take $(p', q') \\in A, |q'| = N + 1$. As just shown, there exists $(p, q) \\in A, |p| < |q| \\le N$ such that\n\n\\[\n\\frac{p'}{q'} = \\frac{1}{2\\ell + \\frac{p}{q}}.\n\\]\n\nThe induction step is complete and the result follows. Note that it also follows that the representation of numbers in $A$ as continued fractions like that is unique. Indeed, take a pair $(p', q') \\in A$. The pair $(p, q) \\in A$ that satisfies (4) and $|p| < |p'|$ is determined uniquely. Uniqueness follows easily.\n\n\\textbf{Remark.} The main difficulty in my opinion is that the answer wasn't told to the students. The result could have been much better otherwise. Some motivation about guessing the answer can be found in this blog $\\Box$",

We delete the remaining edges and prove that there exists a connected component with at least $m+n$ vertices in the remaining graph. The idea is to consider all the connected components. If each one has less than $m+n$ vertices, then the graph is too fragmented and it's impossible to have too many (at least $kmn$) edges even if all edges are present in every connected component. It boils down to prove a certain inequality.\n\n\\textbf{Lemma.} Let $x, y$ be two positive real numbers and $\\ell, k$; $\\ell \\ge k$ be natural numbers. Let $x_i, y_i, i = 1, 2, \\dots, \\ell$ satisfy the following conditions.\n\n$$\nx_i \\ge 0, y_i \\ge 0, x_i + y_i \\le (x+y)/k, i = 1, 2, \\dots, \\ell;\n$$\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{\\ell} x_i = x, \\quad \\sum_{i=1}^{\\ell} y_i = y. \\qquad (1)\n$$\n\nThen it holds\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{\\ell} x_i y_i \\le \\frac{xy}{k}.\n$$\n\nThe equality is reached only if $x_i = x/k, y_i = y/k, i = 1, 2, \\dots, k$; $x_i = y_i = 0, i > k$.\n\n\\textbf{Proof.} Let us denote $f(x, y) := \\sum_{i=1}^{\\ell} x_i y_i$, where $x = (x_1, \\dots, x_\\ell)$, $y = (y_1, \\dots, y_\\ell)$. The conditions in (1) determine a compact set, hence $f$ attains its maximum value on it, say, at the points $x'_i, y'_i, i = 1, 2, \\dots, \\ell$. We can assume $x'_1 \\ge x'_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge x'_\\ell$. We shall prove that $y'_i$ are also in decreasing order. Let us assume on the contrary that $y'_i < y'_{i+1}$. Set\n\n$$\nx_i = x_{i+1} := (x'_i + x'_{i+1})/2; \\quad y_i = y_{i+1} := (y'_i + y'_{i+1})/2.\n$$\n\nThen (Chebyshev inequality)\n\n$$\nx_i y_i + x_{i+1} y_{i+1} > x'_i y'_i + x'_{i+1} y'_{i+1}.\n$$\n\nBut it contradicts the maximality of $x'_i, y'_i, i = 1, \\dots, \\ell$. Next, if $x'_1 + y'_1 < (x+y)/k$ we can similarly set $x_1 := x'_1 + \\varepsilon, x_2 := x'_2 - \\varepsilon; y_1 := y'_1 + \\delta, x_2 := x'_2 - \\delta$ for sufficiently small $\\varepsilon, \\delta \\ge 0$ and get a larger value of $f$. Therefore, $x'_1 + y'_1 = (x+y)/k$.\n\nLet $k'$ be the largest index for which $x_{k'} > 0$ and $y_{k'} > 0$. In the same way we can see that $x'_i + y'_i = (x+y)/k, i = 1, 2, \\dots, k'$. Hence, $k' \\le k$. Assume that $k' < k$ and $y_i = 0, i > k'$. We modify $x', y'$ as follows. Set\n\n$$\nx_i := x'_i, y_i := y'_i, i = 1, 2, \\dots, k' - 1; \\\\ x_{k'} := x'_{k'}, y_{k'} := y'_{k'} - \\varepsilon, x_{k'+1} := (x+y)/k, y_{k'+1} := \\varepsilon.\n$$\n\nFor $i > k' + 1$ we set $y_i = 0$, and the values of $x_i, i > k' + 1$ are irrelevant providing they comply with (1). Since $x'_k < (x+y)/k$, it can be seen that $f(x, y) > f(x', y')$ which contradicts the maximality of $x', y'$.\n\nThus, $k' = k$. We prove that $x'_i = x/k, y'_i = y/k, i = 1, 2, \\dots, k$. Assume on the contrary it doesn't hold and let $j$ be the first index for which $x'_j \\neq x/k$. WLOG let $x'_j < x/k$. Then there exists $i > j$ for which $x'_i > x/k$. This means $x'_i > x'_j$ and thus the sequence $x'_1, x'_2, \\dots, x'_k$ is not decreasing, contradiction. To recap, we established that $x'_i = x/k, y'_i = y/k, i = 1, 2, \\dots, k$. In this case $f(x', y') = kxy$, and Lemma 1 is proved. \\Box\n\nBack to the problem. The number of all edges of $K$ is $k^2mn$, hence there is a color, say, white such that at least $kmn$ edges are colored white. We delete all edges colored in a color other than white. We'll prove that in the remaining graph $K'$, there exists a connected component with at least $m+n$ vertices. Assume on the contrary it is not true. Denote the connected components of $K'$ by $G(A_i, B_i), i = 1, 2, \\dots, \\ell$ and let $|A_i| = m_i, |B_i| = n_i, i = 1, 2, \\dots, \\ell$. We have\n\n$$\n\\sum i = 1^\\ell m_i = km, \\sum_{i=1}^\\ell n_i = kn, m_i + n_i < m + n.\n$$\n\nAccording to Lemma 1,\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{\\ell} m_i n_i < kmn\n$$\n\nwhich contradicts the choice of the white color. This means that for at least one index $i$ it holds $m_i + n_i \\ge m + n$.\n\n\\textbf{Remark.} More comments can be found in this blog.

Fix some $d, d < 1$, it may be very close to 1. Take an equilateral triangle with side length 1 and put inside it $3n$ points - $n$ points near each of its vertices so that they be at distance less than $(1 - d)/2$ from the corresponding vertex - fig 1. This set of points apparently is a good set. A disk with radius $d$ cannot cover a point that is near to one vertex and a point near another vertex. That is, the maximum number of points that could be covered with such a disk is $n$. This means that $m(n, d) \\le n$ no matter how close to 1 the value of $d$ is.\n\nФигура 1\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/BGR_ABooklet_2024_p12_data_a840979964.png)\n\nWe will prove that $m(n, d) = n$ when $d$ is close to 1. To prove this we need to study the good set of points. How close together are its points? Can we claim that all of them lie in disk with some not too large radius? Of course, they lie in a disk with radius 1 since if you take one of the points, the rest are at distance at most 1 from this point. But can we claim that all of them lie in a disk with a smaller radius? Clearly, they may not lie in a disk with radius $1/2$ - the equilateral triangle with side length 1 is an example that disproves this. Crucial to this problem is the following observation.\n\n**Lemma.** Any good set can be put inside a disk with radius $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$. That is, any good set can be put inside a circle circumscribed about an equilateral triangle with a side length 1.\n\nThe official solution proves it by using Helly's theorem which is instructive. Another method is used here.\n\n**Proof.** Let $X$ be a good set. We first show that $X$ lies in a circle circumscribed about an acute triangle with side lengths less or equal to 1. Take the convex hull of $X$ and put it inside a circle with some radius. We begin to tighten this circle until it touches 1 and then 2 points of the convex hull. We can tighten the circle further unless these two points lie on its diameter. In this case $A$ lies in a circle with a diameter at most 1. So, assume we decrease the circle $k$ until it touches 3 points of $X$, say $A, B, C$. If these points are vertices of an acute triangle we done, so suppose $\\angle ACB \\ge 90^\\circ$ see fig.2. We begin to further decrease the diameter of $k$ keeping the points $A$ and $B$ on the circle. This can be done until the first of the following two events happens:\n\n1. The circle hits a point $C' \\in X$ (and $C'$ and $C$ lie on different sides of $AB$).\n2. $AB$ becomes a diameter of $k$.",

We construct three disks with diameters $AB, BC, CD$ correspondingly. These disks cover all the points inside $k$ except the red piece in fig 3. Note now that by taking $d$ close to 1, the point $D$ will be as close to $A$ as we want. This means that we can make the red piece on fig 3 as small as we want. We take $d$ so close to 1 so that the measure of the arc $AD$ (on fig. 3)",
