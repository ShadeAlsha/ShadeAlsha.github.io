The value 243 is attained for the triple (91, 81, 71) which is admissible.\n\nIf $b-c \\ne 101-a$ then $b-c \\ge (99-a)+4 = 103-a > 0$, hence\n\n$$\na + b + c = a + \\frac{(99-a)(99+a)}{b-c} \\le a + \\frac{(99-a)(99+a)}{103-a}.\n$$\n\nTo complete the proof it suffices to show that $a + \\frac{(99-a)(99+a)}{103-a} < 243$ whenever $a < 99$. Use the last inequality to reach the equivalent form $a^2 - 73a + 7614 > 0$. The latter holds for all real $a$ since the trinomial $a^2 - 73a + 7614$ has a negative discriminant.",

Assume the positions labeled 1, 2, ..., 100 from right to left. A type 1 position does not yield a carryover to the next one (even if it receives one from the previous position). On the contrary, a type 2 position passes on a carryover to the next position. Divide all positions from right to left into blocks $B_1, B_2, B_3, \\dots$ with type 1 positions in $B_1, B_3, B_5, \\dots$ and type 2 positions in $B_2, B_4, B_6, \\dots$. The digits of $A$ and $B$ in $B_1$, if any, yield digits 8 in the sum $A+B=C$ and no carryovers. They are not related to the digits 1, 4 and 9 of $C$ which we are about to discuss.\n\nCall *special* all digits 1 and 4 of $C$. The first position of block $B_2$ yields a special digit for $C$. It receives no carryover from its right neighbor, the last position of the type 1 block $B_1$. So the respective digit of $C$ is the last digit of 7+4 or 7+7, i. e. 1 or 4. Each remaining position of $B_2$ (if any) yields a digit 2 or 5 for $C$ because it receives a carryover from its right neighbor; also it passes on a carryover to the next position. So exactly one position in $B_2$ provides a special digit for $C$, and $B_2$ yields no digits 9.\n\nNow look at the first position of block $B_3$. The respective digit of $C$ is 9: the sum of the two 4's from $A$ and $B$ plus the carryover from the last position in $B_2$. Each remaining position of $B_3$ (if any) yields a digit 8 for $C$ and no carryover. So exactly one position in $B_3$ provides a 9 for $C$, and $B_3$ yields no special digits.\n\nThe reasoning about $B_2$ and $B_3$ repeats without change for all subsequent blocks. Each of the blocks $B_2, B_4, B_6, \\dots$ yields for $C$ one special digit and no digits 9. Each of the blocks $B_3, B_5, \\dots$ yields one digit 9 and no special digits. Recall that the initial block $B_1$ does not contribute digits 1, 4 and 9.\n\nThe sum $C = A+B$ has more digits than the summands, so there is a carryover at the last position 100 and $C$ has a 1 at position 101. The carryover means that position 100 is of type 2, in a block with even index. Then it follows from the above that the number of special digits at positions 1, 2, ..., 100 exceeds by 1 the number $N$ of digits 9. All digits 9 of $C$ are at these positions, hence $N = 30$ by hypothesis. So $C$ has $30+1=31$ special digits at 1, 2, ..., 100, and 32 special digits in all due to the leading 1. Of these 32 digits 20 are 4's, hence $C$ has $32-20=12$ digits 1.",

So we may argue about 0-1 sequences instead of selections. Such a sequence $\\alpha = a_1a_2 \\dots a_{1000}$ is admissible if it contains exactly $k$ ones, if no two ones in it are adjacent, and if at least one of $a_1$ and $a_{1000}$ is zero. We distinguish between two types of admissible sequences: type 1 with $a_1 = 0$ and type 2 with $a_1 = 1$.\n\nLet $\\alpha$ be a type 1 admissible sequence. Since $a_1 = 0$, every term 1 in it is preceded by at least one 0. Delete one zero in front of each 1. A 0-1 sequence $\\alpha'$ of length 1000 - $k$ is obtained, with $k$ terms 1. Call the latter a sequence of type 1'; there are $\\binom{1000-k}{k}$ of these. Writing a 0 in front of every 1 in $\\alpha'$ restores back the original $\\alpha$. It follows that $\\alpha \\mapsto \\alpha'$ is an injection from the set of type 1 admissible sequences into the set of type 1' sequences. Now take a type 1' sequence and write a zero in front of each of the $k$ terms 1. The result is an admissible type 1 sequence: it contains $k$ ones, no two of them adjacent due to the added zeros, and the first term is a zero. Thus $\\alpha \\mapsto \\alpha'$ is a bijection, implying that there are $\\binom{1000-k}{k}$ type 1 admissible sequences.\n\nLet $\\alpha$ be a type 2 admissible sequence. Here $a_1 = 1$, therefore $a_{1000} = a_2 = 0$. Thus each term $a_j = 1$ with $j > 1$ is preceded by at least one 0. Delete one zero in front of every such term, also delete $a_1 = 1$ and $a_{1000} = 0$. The obtained 0-1 sequence $\\alpha'$ has length 999 - $k$ and $k-1$ terms 1. Call the latter a sequence of type 2'; there are $\\binom{999-k}{k-1}$ of these. Like in the previous case $\\alpha \\mapsto \\alpha'$ is a bijection, hence there are $\\binom{999-k}{k-1}$ type 2 admissible sequences.\n\nIn summary there are $\\binom{1000-k}{k} + \\binom{999-k}{k-1}$ admissible selections.",

For each $i = 1, \\dots, n$ the hypothesis implies that $\\alpha$ starts with a block $B_i$, followed by a term $i$ which we called distinguished, and ends with a block $B'_i$ identical with $B_i$. Choose the blocks $B_i$ to be shortest possible; they are uniquely determined and different. By relabeling if necessary one may ensure $|B_n| > |B_{n-1}| > \\dots > |B_1|$. (Under this assumption $\\alpha$ starts with a 1 and the shortest block $B_1$ is empty: $|B_1| = 0$.)\n\nWe claim that block $B'_n$ does not contain the distinguished $n$. Otherwise $B_n$ and $B'_n$ have a common part $a_1, \\dots, a_m$, possibly empty; clearly $m < |B_n|$. Now $B'_n$ starts with $a_1, \\dots, a_m, n$ and $B_n$ ends with $a_1, \\dots, a_m$. Since $B_n$ and $B'_n$ are identical, $\\alpha$ starts with $a_1, \\dots, a_m, n$ and ends with $a_1, \\dots, a_m$. But then $m < |B_n|$ contradicts the minimum choice of $B_n$. So the distinguished $n$ is not in $B'_n$. Consequently the length $\\ell$ of $\\alpha$ satisfies $\\ell \\ge 2|B_n| + 1$.\n\nA similar argument applies to blocks $B_n$ and $B_{n-1}$ and shows that $|B_n| \\ge 2|B_{n-1}| + 1$. Indeed $B_n$ starts with $B_{n-1}$, which is followed by the distinguished $n-1$, and $B'_n$ ends with $B'_{n-1}$. Since $B_n$ and $B'_n$ are identical, $B_n$ ends with a block $B''_{n-1}$ identical to $B_{n-1}$ and $B'_{n-1}$. Now we show that $B''_{n-1}$ does not contain the distinguished $n-1$; this will ensure $|B_n| \\ge 2|B_{n-1}| + 1$.\n\nSuppose on the contrary that the distinguished $n-1$ is in $B''_{n-1}$. Then $B_{n-1}$ and $B''_{n-1}$ have a common part $a_1, \\dots, a_m$, possibly empty, where $m < |B_{n-1}|$. Now $B''_{n-1}$ starts with $a_1, \\dots, a_m, n-1$ and $B_{n-1}$ ends with $a_1, \\dots, a_m$. Since $B_{n-1}$, $B'_{n-1}$ and $B''_{n-1}$ are identical, $\\alpha$ starts with $a_1, \\dots, a_m, n-1$ and ends with $a_1, \\dots, a_m$; but then $m < |B_{n-1}|$ contradicts the minimum choice of $B_{n-1}$. The claimed $|B_n| \\ge 2|B_{n-1}| + 1$ follows.\n\nBy the same reasoning $|B_i| \\ge 2|B_{i-1}| + 1$ for all $i = 2, \\dots, n$. Combined with $\\ell \\ge 2|B_n| + 1$ this leads to $\\ell \\ge 2^n - 1$. Hence the initial universal sequence has length $\\ell + 1 \\ge 2^n$.\n\nOn the other hand for each $n$ there are universal sequences $\\beta_n$ with terms in $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$ and length $2^n$. If $n = 1$ set $\\beta_1 = 1, 1$ (the length is $2 = 2^1$). Suppose that $\\beta_{n-1}$ is a universal sequence with terms in $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n-1\\}$ and length $2^{n-1}$. Write $n$ in front of every term of $\\beta_{n-1}$. The obtained sequence $\\beta_n$ has terms in $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$ and length $2^n$. In addition $\\beta_n$ is universal. Indeed replacing the final 1 by $n$ yiedls a smooth sequence (starting and ending with $n$). Replace the final 1 by $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n - 1\\}$; let $\\beta'_n$ be the new sequence. Suppose that the final 1 in $\\beta_{n-1}$ is also replaced by $i$. Then the resulting sequence would start and end with a block $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_m, i$ with $a_j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n - 1\\}$. By the definition of $\\beta_n$ then $\\beta'_n$ starts and ends with $n, a_1, n, a_2, \\dots, n, a_m, n, i$, meaning that it is smooth. This completes the inductive construction and the proof.",

Let $k > 2$ be the first number such that $r_k \\ne k - 1$. Then $r_j = j - 1$ for $j = 2, \\dots, k - 1$, so $r_k \\ne 1, 2, \\dots, k - 2$ because the $r_j$ are pairwise distinct. On the other hand $0 \\le r_k \\le k - 1$, hence $r_k \\neq k-1$ implies $r_k = 0$. Thus remainder 0 is obtained upon division by the least $k$ such that $r_k \\neq k-1$.\n\nObserve now that $k$ is a prime. If $d$ is a proper divisor of $k$ then $2 \\le d < k$, hence $r_d = d-1$ by the minimality of $k$. However $d$ divides $k$ and $k$ divides $N$ (as $r_k = 0$), so $d$ divides $N$, yielding $r_d = 0$ which is false. So $k > 2$ is a prime.\n\nNext we show that $k > 500$. Suppose not; then $2k \\le 100$ and we determine $r_{2k}$ directly. Since $k$ divides $N$ and $N$ is odd, one can write $N = (2s+1)k$ for some integer $s$. Then $N = s(2k)+k$ and because $0 < k < 2k$, it follows that $r_{2k} = k$. However look also at $r_{k+1}$. It is different from $0, 1, \\dots, k-2$ (the remainders $r_2, r_3, \\dots, r_k$) and does not exceed $k$. Because $k+1 \\ne 2k$ and $r_{2k} = k$, the only remaining possibility is $r_{k+1} = k-1$. Hence $N = q(k+1) + (k-1)$ for some integer $q$. But $k+1$ and $k-1$ are both even as $k$ is odd; so $N$ is even which is a contradiction.\n\nWe proved that $k$ is a prime greater than 500. Conversely, every prime $p \\in (500, 1000)$ serves the purpose for a suitable odd $N$. Let $M$ be the least common multiple of $2, 3, \\dots, p-1, p+1, \\dots, 1000$. Consider $Mx-1$ for $x = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$. Because $p$ is coprime to $M$ due to $2p > 1000$, there is an $x$ such that $Mx-1$ is divisible by $p$. Set $N = Mx-1$, then $p$ divides $N$, so $r_p = 0$. Also each $j = 2, 3, \\dots, p-1, p+1, \\dots, 1000$ divides $M$ and hence also $N+1$. Thus $N$ is congruent to $-1$ modulo $j$, meaning that $r_j = j-1$. The numbers $r_2, r_3, \\dots, r_{1000}$ are pairwise distinct and one of them is 0. The answer is: all primes between 500 and 1000.",

Clearly $N$ is at most the total number of 5's in the prime factorizations of $a, b, c$. Let $5^k, 5^l, 5^m$ be the highest powers of 5 dividing $a, b, c$ respectively. Assume $k \\ge l \\ge m$ by symmetry. We have $k \\le 4$ as $5^5 > 1810$. If $m = 0$ (i. e. $5 \\nmid c$) then $l = 0$ because $5 \\mid 1810$, so that $N \\le k \\le 4$. And if $m \\ge 1$ then $m = 1$ since 1810 is exactly divisible by 5. Hence $N \\le 4+4+1=9$. However $N=8$ and $N=9$ cannot occur.\n\nIndeed $N \\ge 8$ only if $k=4$ and $m=1$, hence $k+l+m \\ge N \\ge 8$ yields $l \\ge 3$. Thus $(k,l,m) = (4,3,1)$ or $(k,l,m) = (4,4,1)$. In the first case $a$ is divisible by $5^4 = 625$, in the second case so are $a$ and $b$. Note that some of $a,b,c$ can be a multiple of $5^4 = 625$ only if it is even. Indeed having an odd summand in $a+b+c = 1810$ means having exactly two odd ones as 1810 is even. Since $N$ is at most the total number of 2's in the prime factorizations of $a,b,c$, $N \\ge 8$ implies that the third number must be divisible by $5 \\cdot 2^8 = 1280$. This cannot hold as $625 + 1280 > 1810$.\n\nSo $a \\ge 2 \\cdot 625 = 1250$ for $(k,l,m) = (4,3,1)$ and $a, b \\ge 1250$ for $(k,l,m) = (4,4,1)$. Thus the latter is rejected together with $N=9$ ($1250+1250 > 1810$). There remains $N=8$ with $(k,l,m) = (4,3,1)$ and $a = 1250$ ($a$ is an even multiple of 625 and also $4 \\cdot 625 > 1810$). Here $b+c=560$ and $5^3|b$; moreover it is clear that $b$ is even. Thus $b=2 \\cdot 125=250$ or $b=4 \\cdot 125=500$, but neither one gives a product $abc$ divisible by $10^8$.

At least 5 groups of the 9 groups in division 1 consist of exactly 1 weight, so there are 5 weights of mass 20, say $a_1, \\dots, a_5$. They are in different groups in division 2 where the mass of one group is $180/5 = 36$. Remove $a_1, \\dots, a_5$ from their groups to obtain a division of $a_6, \\dots, a_{13}$ into 5 groups of mass 16. In particular $a_i \\le 16$ for $6 \\le i \\le 13$. So in division 1 the 8 weights $a_6, \\dots, a_{13}$ are divided into 4 pairs with mass 20 each, say $\\{a_6, a_7\\}, \\{a_8, a_9\\}, \\{a_{10}, a_{11}\\}, \\{a_{12}, a_{13}\\}$. There is also a division of $a_6, \\dots, a_{13}$ into 5 groups of mass 16; two of these groups must have exactly one weight. Hence one may assume $a_6 = a_8 = 16$, implying $a_7 = a_9 = 4$. All $a_i$ determined so far are integer multiples of 4.\n\nEach group in division 3 has mass $180/4 = 45$ which is not a multiple of 4. Hence each group contains a non-multiple of 4, i. e. an integer not divisible by 4 or a non-integer. As $a_1, \\dots, a_9$ are divisible by 4, the non-multiples of 4 are $a_{10}, a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{13}$, and they belong to different groups. We obtain that each of $a_{10}, a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{13}$ differs from 45 by a multiple of 4, so it is an integer congruent to 1 modulo 4. But then $a_{10} + a_{11} \\ne 20$ which is a contradiction.\n\n[The reasoning modulo 4 can be avoided. We proved that weights $a_6, \\dots, a_{13}$ form 5 groups of mass 16—hence each one has mass at most 16—and also 4 pairs with mass 20—so each one has mass at least 4. Two of the 5 weights with mass 20 are in the same group in division 3. The mass 45 of the group is completed by exactly one weight of mass 5: having two or more weights of total mass 5 would yield a mass less than 4. The weight 5 must be paired up with a weight 15 in a group of mass 20. However the 15 is also in a group of mass 16 which is impossible by the above.]\n\nSo there is no admissible collection with 13 weights (and hence with fewer weights either). An admissible collection with 14 weights is 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 20, 20, 20, 20; divisions 1, 2 and 3 are:\n\n$\\{3, 17\\}, \\{4, 16\\}, \\{5, 15\\}, \\{7, 13\\}, \\{9, 11\\}, \\{20\\}, \\{20\\}, \\{20\\}, \\{20\\}$; \\\\\n$\\{3, 13, 20\\}, \\{4, 15, 17\\}, \\{5, 11, 20\\}, \\{7, 9, 20\\}, \\{16, 20\\}$; \\\\\n$\\{3, 4, 7, 11, 20\\}, \\{5, 20, 20\\}, \\{9, 16, 20\\}, \\{13, 15, 17\\}$.",

          "latex": "For an admissible coloring let the 13-cell shape shown in the figure be entirely inside the table. Observe that the central row of 5 represents all 5 colors, as well as the central column of 5. Assume on the contrary that the central row misses color 1. Since the crosses centered at *a*, *b*, *c* contain color 1, this color occurs 3 times in the union of the two rows of 3 above and under *abc*. This union is covered by the two crosses centered at the cells • adjacent to *b*. However these crosses combined represent each color at most twice. The claim is proven.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Argentina_2011_p18_data_f81a2dfb70.png)\n\nWe argue for a general $n \\times n$ square where $n > 5$. Every 5 consecutive cells in rows 3, 4, ..., $n-2$ form the central row of 5 in a shape like above, so they represent all 5 colors. The same holds for every 5 consecutive cells in columns 3, 4, ..., $n-2$. Hence the coloring of the rows and columns mentioned is periodic with period 5. Write $a_{ij}$ for the cell in row $i$ and column $j$, \"cross $a_{ij}$\" for the cross centered at $a_{ij}$ and $a_{ij} = c$ if $a_{ij}$ has color $c$. Note that any two adjacent cells not at the border of the table are contained in some cross, so they are colored differently.\n\nFix the colors of the first 5 cells in row 3 and the second cell in row 2. Cells $a_{31}, a_{32}, a_{33}, a_{34}, a_{35}$ have different colors, label them 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The color of $a_{22}$ is not arbitrary: one infers from cross $a_{32}$ that $\\{a_{22}, a_{42}\\} = \\{4, 5\\}$. Let $a_{22} = 4$, $a_{42} = 5$, the case $a_{22} = 5$, $a_{42} = 4$ is analogous. We show that then the entire coloring is determined apart from the colors of 3 cells at each corner: the vertex cell and its two neighbors by side. Call $F$ the figure obtained by ignoring these 12 cells.\n\nThe coloring of row 3 is determined: $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \\dots$. By considering cross $a_{33}$ we find $\\{a_{23}, a_{43}\\} = \\{1, 5\\}$; since $a_{42} = 5$ and $a_{42} \\neq a_{43}$, it follows that $a_{23} = 5$, $a_{43} = 1$. The same argument for crosses $a_{34}$ and $a_{35}$ shows that $a_{24} = 1$, $a_{44} = 2$, $a_{25} = 2$, $a_{45} = 3$. The colors of 4 consecutive cells in row 4 are known now, from the second to the fifth, so row 4 has coloring $4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, \\dots$. The remaining crosses centered in row 3 determine the colors in row 2 without its first and last cell: $4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, \\dots$. After this consider the crosses centered at row 2 except $a_{22}$ and $a_{2,n-1}$. They determine the colors in row 1 without its first two and last two cells: $2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, \\dots$.\n\nOnce the coloring of row 4 is known, we proceed analogously to rows $5, \\dots, n-2$ to achieve the same. For the next-to-last row $n-1$ the colors are determined uniquely except for the first and the last cell. For the last row $n$ we use the crosses in row $n-1$ different from $a_{n-1,2}$ and $a_{n-1,n-1}$. This yields the colors in row $n$ apart from the ones of the first two and the last two cells. Thus the coloring of figure $F$ is indeed completely determined.\n\nThere remain the three cells at each corner. We infer from cross $a_{22}$ that $\\{a_{12}, a_{21}\\} = \\{1, 3\\}$, and the two possibilities for $a_{12}$ and $a_{21}$ are feasible as there are no more restrictions on their colors. Likewise there are 2 possibilities for the colors of the analogous pairs at the other three corners. As for the colors of the 4 vertex cells, there are no restrictions at all.\n\nInitially we fixed the colors of $a_{31}, a_{32}, a_{33}, a_{34}, a_{35}$ and $a_{22}$ which can be done in $5! \\cdot 2$ ways. Then there are 2 choices for the coloring of the pair $a_{12}, a_{21}$ and 2 choices for each analogous pair at the corners. Last, there are 5 choices for the color of each vertex cell.\n\nEvery combination of the choices described yields a coloring with the stated property. Therefore the number of admissible colorings is $5! \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2^4 \\cdot 5^4 = 4! \\cdot 10^5 = 2400000$.",

In addition triangle $AMC$ is right and isosceles, with $\\angle AMC = \\angle MAC = 45^\\circ$.\n\nWe employ the equality $AV^2 = AP \\cdot AQ$ again to compute PQ. Fisrt, $AV = \\frac{1}{2}(AB+AC-BC) = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}$. (If the incircle touches AB at T then $AV = AT$, $BT = BU$, $CU = CV$ imply $AV+BU+CU = \\frac{1}{2}(AB + BC + CA)$; on the other hand $BU + CU = BC$.) Second, AM and PQ have common midpoint N because $AP = QM$. So if $PQ = 2x$ then $PN = NQ = x$, $AP = AN-x$, $AQ = AN+x$. Since N is the midpoint of the hypotenuse AM of the right triangle AMC with $\\angle MAC = 45^\\circ$, we have $AN = \\frac{AC}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Thus $AV^2 = AP \\cdot AQ$ takes the form $(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2})^2 = (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} - x)(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + x)$, or $\\frac{3-\\sqrt{5}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} - x^2$. Hence $x = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{5}-2}{2}}$, $PQ = 2x = \\sqrt{2\\sqrt{5}-4}$.",

A makes his first move in a triple. Then he can ensure to be the one making the last move in each group as follows:\n\na) If B moves in the double, A repeats the same move with the second gap in the double.\n\nb) If B is the one to move first in a triple, A moves first in another triple.\n\nc) If B is the one to move second in a triple, A makes the third remaining move in the same triple.\n\nObserve that A can always stick to these rules because there are an odd number of triples (669) and his initial move is in one of them. Hence if several moves were made according to a)–c) and it is B's turn to play, there are an even number of triples where no move was made; and 1 or 3 moves were made in each remaining triple.\n\nIn case b) A's move can be arbitrary. In case c), where A completes a triple T, he plays to ensure the following. If eventually T has the form $0 \\times 1 + 2 \\times 0$ then the two $*$ are the same; and if T has the form $0 \\times 1 \\times 2 \\times 0$ then one of the two $*$ is $\\times$. This is always possible by direct verification.\n\nAfter all moves are complete we obtain the sum S of several products, some of them possibly with one factor. If a product in S does not contain 0 then it can be 1, 2 or $1 \\times 2$; however $1 \\times 2$ is excluded. Indeed, such a $1 \\times 2$ cannot come from a triple $0 \\times 1 \\times 2 \\times 0$ because by the previous paragraph one of the two $*$ is $\\times$. Similarly if a $1 \\times 2$ comes from the double $1 \\times 2 \\times 0$ then $*$ is $\\times$.\n\nSo a product in S without a 0 is either a 1 or a 2, meaning that it is contained in a part $...+1+2...$ or $...1+2+...$ of S. If the 1 and the 2 are in a triple $0 \\times 1 + 2 \\times 0$ then the triple is $0+1+2+0$ as the two $*$ are the same, and one is a $+$. If the 1 and the 2 are in the double $1+2+0$ then the double is $1+2+0$ (by a)). We conclude that the products without a 0 in S come in pairs of the form $...+1+2+...$ or $1+2+...$ (for the double). It follows that S is divisible by 3, so A wins.",

We find $M(n)$ for $n = 1, \\dots, 6$. Clearly $M(1) = 1$. Family 2 consists of the primes not exceeding 100, of which there are 25; so $M(2) = 25$. Family 3 is the set of numbers $p^2$ where $p$ is a prime. Its members are $2^2, 3^2, 5^2, 7^2$, hence $M(3) = 4$.\n\nThe members of family 4 are the numbers $pq$ where $p, q$ are distinct primes, and the cubes $p^3$ with $p$ a prime. If $pq$ is a member of the first kind with $p < q$ then $p \\in \\{2, 3, 5, 7\\}$. To $p = 2$ there correspond 14 members: $2 \\cdot 3, 2 \\cdot 5, \\dots, 2 \\cdot 47$.

The white part can be regarded as the union of $k$ white diagonals with $k+1$ cells in each, running from top left to bottom right. Likewise the black part is the union of $k$ black diagonals with $k+1$ cells in each, running from top right to bottom left. Pressing the switch in a cell $C$ can change only the state of cells with the opposite color, and only in diagonals containing cells adjacent to $C$. Moreover, observe that if a diagonal (of the opposite color) is affected by pressing the switch in $C$ then exactly two bulbs in it change state. Consequently the parity of the number of bulbs in state on is constant for every diagonal. All bulbs were off initially. Hence each diagonal contains an even number of bulbs that are on, after any number of moves.\n\nIf $k$ is even, it follows that at least one of the $k+1$ bulbs in each of the $2k$ diagonals is off after any number of moves. So at most $(2k^2 + 2k) - 2k = 2k^2$ bulbs on can be obtained. (No similar restriction follows for $k$ odd.) We present examples that all $2k^2 + 2k$ bulbs can be turned on in the odd case, and exactly $2k^2$ bulbs on can be achieved in the even case.\n\nFor $k$ odd the procedure involves only switches in odd-numbered rows (from top to bottom). Press the two switches in row 1. In row 3 press the pairs of switches (1,2) and (5,6); in row 5 the pairs (1,2), (5,6) and (9,10). Proceed similarly till row $k$ (which is involved in the process since $k$ is odd): press the first two switches, jump over the next two and so on. For the odd-numbered rows $k+2, k+4, \\dots, 2k-1$ the rule is similar. We press two switches and jump over the next two, but starting with the second switch in each of these rows. Every cell in the $k$-table has exactly one neighbor whose switch is pressed.

So at most $(2k^2 + 2k) - 2k = 2k^2$ bulbs on can be obtained. (No similar restriction follows for $k$ odd.) We present examples that all $2k^2 + 2k$ bulbs can be turned on in the odd case, and exactly $2k^2$ bulbs on can be achieved in the even case.\n\nFor $k$ odd the procedure involves only switches in odd-numbered rows (from top to bottom). Press the two switches in row 1. In row 3 press the pairs of switches (1,2) and (5,6); in row 5 the pairs (1,2), (5,6) and (9,10). Proceed similarly till row $k$ (which is involved in the process since $k$ is odd): press the first two switches, jump over the next two and so on. For the odd-numbered rows $k+2, k+4, \\dots, 2k-1$ the rule is similar. We press two switches and jump over the next two, but starting with the second switch in each of these rows. Every cell in the $k$-table has exactly one neighbor whose switch is pressed. Hence all bulbs will be on eventually.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Argentina_2011_p32_data_2a8eb53ab1.png)\n\n$k$ odd\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Argentina_2011_p32_data_8c27b4f2b5.png)\n\n$k$ even"

Choose a black cell on every side (there is at least one by minimality) and label these $A, B, C, D$ as in the first figure. Consider the special rectangles $[AB], [BC], [CD], [DA]$ and $[AC]$. Here we write $[XY]$ for the grid rectangle with opposite corner cells $X$ and $Y$ (they determine the rectangle uniquely). Note that if the part of $R$ to the left of rectangle $[AC]$ is ignored, the remainder is covered by $[AB], [BC]$ and $[AC]$. Likewise if the part of $R$ to the right of $[AC]$ is ignored, the remainder is covered by $[CD], [DA]$ and $[AC]$. Hence the entire $R$ is covered by the five rectangles, with certain overlaps. Each of cells $A$ and $C$ belongs to 3 of the 5 rectangles; each of $B$ and $D$ belongs to 2 of them. (There may be other black cells contained in more than one rectangle.) Hence if $x_1, \\dots, x_5$ are the numbers of black cells in the 5 rectangles we obtain $x_1 + \\dots + x_5 \\ge 995 + 3 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 2 = 1005$. This is because the sum counts each black cell except $A, B, C, D$ at least once, each of $B$ and $D$ at least twice, and each of $A$ and $C$ at least thrice. It follows that one of $x_1, \\dots, x_5$ is at least $\\frac{1005}{5} = 201$. So there is always a special rectangle with at least 201 black cells. Therefore $N \\ge 201$ for every configuration.\n\nWe tacitly assumed that $A, B, C, D$ are distinct. This can be ensured indeed unless there are no black cells on some two adjacent sides of $R$ except their common corner cell. But then it is clear that $R$ can be covered by at most 3 special rectangles like the ones above, so $N > 201$. (We ignore the trivial case where $R$ has a side 1.)\n\nNow we show an example where $N = 201$. In the second figure the 999 black squares are inside a big $3k \\times 3k$ grid square, with $k > 400$. Four groups 1, 2, 3, 4 of 200 black cells each are placed in the corner $k \\times k$ squares as shown, in a diagonal-like manner.\n\nNote that adjacent corner groups are separated by a horizontal line and also by a vertical line. The remaining 199 black cells are in the central $k \\times k$ square. Their exact location is irrelevant.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Argentina_2011_p39_data_f9e2490a89.png)\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Argentina_2011_p39_data_973aeeaf1a.png)\n\nLet X and Y be opposite black corner cells of a special rectangle T which contains m black cells. If X and Y are in the same group it is clear that $m \\le 200$. If X and Y are in adjacent groups among 1, 2, 3, 4 then T intersects only these two groups. In addition observe that one of the two groups has exactly one cell in T (this is X or Y). Thus $m \\le 200 + 1 = 201$.\n\nLet X and Y be in opposite corner groups, say 1 and 3. Then T does not intersect groups 2 and 4. Moreover X and Y are the only black cells of T from groups 1 and 3. The remaining ones are all in the central part. Hence $m \\le 199 + 2 = 201$. Finally let one of X and Y be in the central group, say X. If Y is also there then $m \\le 199$. And if Y is in a corner group then Y is the only black cell of T out of the central part. So $m \\le 199 + 1 = 200$ which completes the solution.",

For each $i = 1, \\dots, n$ the hypothesis implies that $\\alpha$ starts with a block $B_i$, followed by a term $i$ which we called distinguished, and ends with a block $B'_i$ identical with $B_i$. Choose the blocks $B_i$ to be shortest possible; they are uniquely determined and different. By relabeling if necessary one may ensure $|B_n| > |B_{n-1}| > \\dots > |B_1|$. (Under this assumption $\\alpha$ starts with a 1 and the shortest block $B_1$ is empty: $|B_1| = 0$.)\n\nWe claim that block $B'_n$ does not contain the distinguished $n$. Otherwise $B_n$ and $B'_n$ have a common part $a_1, \\dots, a_m$, possibly empty; clearly $m < |B_n|$. Now $B'_n$ starts with $a_1, \\dots, a_m, n$ and $B_n$ ends with $a_1, \\dots, a_m$. Since $B_n$ and $B'_n$ are identical, $\\alpha$ starts with $a_1, \\dots, a_m, n$ and ends with $a_1, \\dots, a_m$. But then $m < |B_n|$ contradicts the minimum choice of $B_n$.

Consequently the length $\\ell$ of $\\alpha$ satisfies $\\ell \\ge 2|B_n| + 1$.\n\nA similar argument applies to blocks $B_n$ and $B_{n-1}$ and shows that $|B_n| \\ge 2|B_{n-1}| + 1$. Indeed $B_n$ starts with $B_{n-1}$, which is followed by the distinguished $n-1$, and $B'_n$ ends with $B'_{n-1}$. Since $B_n$ and $B'_n$ are identical, $B_n$ ends with a block $B''_{n-1}$ identical to $B_{n-1}$ and $B'_{n-1}$. Now we show that $B''_{n-1}$ does not contain the distinguished $n-1$; this will ensure $|B_n| \\ge 2|B_{n-1}| + 1$.\n\nSuppose on the contrary that the distinguished $n-1$ is in $B''_{n-1}$. Then $B_{n-1}$ and $B''_{n-1}$ have a common part $a_1, \\dots, a_m$, possibly empty, where $m < |B_{n-1}|$. Now $B''_{n-1}$ starts with $a_1, \\dots, a_m, n-1$ and $B_{n-1}$ ends with $a_1, \\dots, a_m$. Since $B_{n-1}$, $B'_{n-1}$ and $B''_{n-1}$ are identical, $\\alpha$ starts with $a_1, \\dots, a_m, n-1$ and ends with $a_1, \\dots, a_m$; but then $m < |B_{n-1}|$ contradicts the minimum choice of $B_{n-1}$. The claimed $|B_n| \\ge 2|B_{n-1}| + 1$ follows.\n\nBy the same reasoning $|B_i| \\ge 2|B_{i-1}| + 1$ for all $i = 2, \\dots, n$.

More generally let $b > a > 0$, and let the open interval $\\Delta = (a, b)$ contain an integer (in our case $a = 10^6 - 10^{-6}$, $b = 10^6 + 10^{-6}$). Consider any function $f: \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)$ holds whenever $\\frac{x}{y} \\in \\Delta$. We prove that $f(n) = cn$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ with a real constant $c$.\n\nTo begin with let us show that $f(n+1) - f(n) = f(n) - f(n-1)$ for all sufficiently large $n$. The reason is that for each sufficiently large $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ there is a $z \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that\n\\[\nf(n + 1) - f(n) = f(z + 1) - f(z) = f(n) - f(n - 1).\n\\]\nTo ensure the first equality it is enough to take a $z$ so that $\\frac{z}{n+1} \\in \\Delta$ and $\\frac{z+1}{n} \\in \\Delta$. Then by hypothesis $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)$ will hold with $x = z$, $y = n + 1$ and also with $x = z + 1$, $y = n$. Hence $f(z) + f(n+1) = f(n+z+1) = f(z+1) + f(n)$, as desired. Likewise the second equality will hold provided that $\\frac{z}{n} \\in \\Delta$ and $\\frac{z+1}{n-1} \\in \\Delta$. Since $\\frac{z}{n+1} < \\frac{z}{n} < \\frac{z+1}{n} < \\frac{z+1}{n-1}$, it suffices to find an integer $z$ so that $a < \\frac{z}{n+1}$ and $\\frac{z+1}{n-1} < b$, i. e. $a(n + 1) < z < b(n - 1) - 1$. Such an integer does exist for $n$ large enough. Indeed $b(n - 1) - 1$ and $a(n + 1)$ differ by $(b - a)n - (a + b + 1)$ which is greater than 1 for $n > \\frac{a+b+2}{b-a}$.\n\nIn summary there exists a $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ with such that $f(n+1) - f(n)$ has the same value for all $n \\ge k$. Then by standard induction\n\\[\n(*) \\quad f(n) = (n-k)[f(k+1)-f(k)] + f(k) \\quad \\text{for all } n \\ge k.\n\\]\nThere are $x, y \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $x, y \\ge k$ and $\\frac{x}{y} \\in \\Delta$. For instance choose a rational $\\frac{r}{s} \\in \\Delta$ ($r, s \\in \\mathbb{N}$) and set $x = rk, y = sk$. Take one such pair $x, y$ and compute $f(x), f(y), f(x+y)$ by the formula $(*)$; this can be done because $x, y, x+y \\ge k$. Replace the obtained values in $f(x+y) = f(x)+f(y)$, which holds because $\\frac{x}{y} \\in \\Delta$. Simplification leads to $kf(k+1) = (k+1)f(k)$. Hence $\\frac{f(k)}{k} = \\frac{f(k+1)}{k+1} = c \\in \\mathbb{R}$;\n\nequivalently $f(k) = ck$ and $f(k+1) = c(k+1)$. Then (*) takes the form $f(n) = cn$ for all $n \\ge k$. It remains to show that $f(n) = cn$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nOnly finitely many $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ may possibly disobey $f(n) = cn$. Suppose that such values exist, and let $q$ be the greatest one of them. Choose an integer $w \\in \\Delta$ and set $x = wq, y = q$. Then $x/w \\in \\Delta$, hence $f((w+1)q) = f(wq) + f(q)$. If $w > 1$ then $(w+1)q > wq > q$, so by the choice of $q$ we have $f((w+1)q) = c(w+1)q$, $f(wq) = cwq$. However then $f(q) = c(w+1)q - cwq = cq$, contrary to the assumption that $q$ violates $f(n) = cn$. And if $w = 1$ then $(w+1)q = 2q > q$, so $f(2q) = 2cq$. On the other hand $f((w+1)q) = f(wq) + f(q)$ takes the form $f(2q) = 2f(q)$ which leads to the impossible $f(q) = cq$ again. This completes the proof.\n\n\\textbf{Remark.} The main assumption is $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)$ whenever $x/w \\in \\Delta$, where $\\Delta$ is an arbitrary open interval with positive endpoints. It ensures $f(n) = cn$ for all sufficiently large values of $n$. However the additional assumption that $\\Delta$ contains an integer is essential to infer that $f(n) = cn$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Consider for instance the function $f: \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(n) = n$ for $n \\ge 5$ and $f(n) = 2010$ for $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ (in fact $f(1), f(2), f(3), f(4)$ can be arbitrary). The interval $\\Delta = (3/2, 5/3)$ does not contain fractions with denominators $1, 2, 3, 4$. So $x/w \\in \\Delta$ implies $x \\ge y \\ge 5$; the equation $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)$ is satisfied for such values. Thus $f$ is a function that satisfies the main assumption and $f(n) = n$ for $n \\ge 5$ but not for all $n$.",

In view of $a+c=p+2$ and $b \\le d$ comparison with $S$ shows respectively $(\\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{p+1}{d}) - S = (a-1)(\\frac{1}{d} - \\frac{1}{b}) \\le 0$, $(\\frac{p+1}{b} + \\frac{1}{d}) - S = (c-1)(\\frac{1}{b} - \\frac{1}{d}) \\ge 0$. Hence $\\min S$ is attained with $a = 1, c = p+1$, and $\\max S$ with $a = p+1, c = 1$. Thus $\\max S$ is the greatest value of $\\frac{p+1}{b} + \\frac{1}{p-b}$ where $1 \\le b \\le \\frac{p}{2}$. It is straightforward that $b=1$ yields a maximum. The result is $p+1 + \\frac{1}{p-1}$ which is greater than $p+1$, while $b \\ge 2$ implies $\\frac{p+1}{b} + \\frac{1}{p-b} \\le \\frac{p+1}{2} + 1 < p+1$. In particular $\\max S = 20201 + \\frac{1}{20199}$ for $p = 20200$, attained at $a = 20201, b = 1, c = 1, d = 20199$.\n\nFor the minimum we need the least value of $f(b) = \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{p+1}{p-b}$ where $1 \\le b \\le \\frac{p}{2}$. Examine the difference $f(b) - f(b-1)$ with $b \\ge 2$:\n\n$$\nf(b) - f(b-1) = \\frac{p(b^2 + b - p - 1)}{b(b-1)(p-b)(p-b+1)}\n$$\n\nBecause $b(b-1)(p-b)(p-b+1) > 0$ for $2 \\le b \\le \\frac{p}{2}$, the sign of $f(b) - f(b-1)$ coincides with the sign of $b^2+b-p-1$. For $p = 20200$ this leads to the quadratic function $b^2+b-20201$. It has one negative root and one root between 141 and 142. Hence $b^2 + b - 20201 < 0$ for $2 \\le b \\le 141$ and $b^2 + b - 20201 > 0$ for $b \\ge 142$. It follows that $f(1) > f(2) > \\dots > f(141)$ and $f(141) < f(142) < \\dots$, showing that $\\min f$ is attained at $b = 141$ and equal to $\\frac{1}{141} + \\frac{20201}{20059}$. This is the minimum of $S$ under the given constraints, attained at $a = 1, b = 141, c = 20201, d = 20059$.",

In particular the sum T is even.\n\nThe least possible values of $a_1, \\dots, a_6$ are 1, \\dots, 6. Their sum $1+\\dots+6=21$ is odd, so $T \\neq 21$ and hence $T \\ge 22$. We show that $T=22$ is not possible either.\n\nSuppose that $T=22$. Then it is immediate that $a_1, \\dots, a_6$ are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 in some order. These numbers must be divided into two triples $a_1, a_2, a_3$ and $a_4, a_5, a_6$ with the same sum 11. Each triple must have an odd number of odd numbers, yielding the unique possible division: 1, 3, 7 and 2, 4, 5. By symmetry let $\\{a_1, a_2, a_3\\} = \\{1, 3, 7\\}$, $\\{a_4, a_5, a_6\\} = \\{2, 4, 5\\}$. Since $S=26$, it follows that the sums $a_7+a_8, a_9+a_{10}, a_{11}+a_{12}$ are even, and so is exactly one of the sums $a_8+a_9, a_{10}+a_{11}, a_{12}+a_7$. In all there are exactly two odd sums among $a_7+a_8, a_9+a_{10}, a_{11}+a_{12}, a_{13}+a_{14}, a_{15}+a_7$. They are among $a_8+a_9, a_{10}+a_{11}, a_{12}+a_7$, and the two summand in each one lie in a side of triangle $a_5a_6a_7$.\n\nOn the other hand, $a_7, \\dots, a_{12}$ are 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 in some order. There are 2 odd numbers among them, 9 and 11. They must be at consecutive vertices of the hexagon $a_7a_8\\dots a_{12}$. Otherwise each one has two even neighbors and there are 4 odd sums $a_i+a_{i+1}$, $i=7, 8, \\dots, 12$. Hence a side of triangle $a_1a_2a_3$ or triangle $a_4a_5a_6$ contains 9 and 11. The second case is impossible or else there will be odd sums $a_i+a_{i+1}$ on the sides of $a_1a_2a_3$. Hence 9 and 11 are on a side of $a_1a_2a_3$. Then $S=26$ implies that at the endpoints of this side we have numbers with sum $26-(9+11)=6$. However there are no two numbers with sum 6 in the triple 1, 3, 7.\n\nTherefore $T=22$ cannot occur, so that $T \\ge 24$. An example with $T=24$ is given in the figure. The required minimum is 24.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/3._NATIONAL_XXX_OMA_2013-checkpoint_p1_data_49568da8d3.png)",

Note that the 9 grams coin A and the 11 grams coin B cannot be on the same pan as their positions are consecutive, hence of different parity. If there is equilibrium we claim that, moreover, neither A nor B is on the pans, i.e. they are at positions 19 and 20. Indeed suppose that A or B is on one of the pans. Equilibrium is impossible with exactly one exceptional coin; the other one must be on a pan too. Moreover for equilibrium both of them must be on the same pan; however we remarked that this is not so. Thus A and B are at positions 19 and 20, and since B is the right neighbor of A, we find that the 11 grams coin is the last one. Note that the case of equilibrium needs no further attempts. Let $G_1$ be lighter than $G_2$. Then $A \\in G_1$. Indeed if $A \\in G_1$ then $G_1$ has only 10 grams (it cannot contain B). Hence $G_1$ is lighter only if $B \\in G_2$. So B is at even position 2, 4, ..., 18. But then A is at the previous odd position 1, 3, ..., 17, i. e. it is in $G_1$ contrary to the assumption. Similarly let $G_1$ be heavier than $G_2$. Then $A \\in G_2$. Otherwise $G_2$ has only 10 grams coins and it is lighter only if $B \\in G_1$. So B is at an odd position 3, 5, ..., 17; note is not 1 as B is preceded by A. But then A is at the previous even position 2, 4, ..., 16, i. e. $A \\in G_2$, contrary to the assumption. So in the case of non-equilibrium the first attempt finds a group of 9 coin with 8 of them having the same weight and the last one lighter. It is known how to find the lighter coin with 2 attempts. Divide the coins into 3 groups of 3 and compare two groups. Regardless of the outcome this determines a group of 3 coins containing the lighter one. It remains to compare two coins from G.

More generally Ana can complete her task if $n=0 \\pmod{3}$ ($n \\ge 3$), and Maria can prevent her from doing so if $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$ ($n \\ge 4$).\n\nLet $n$ be a multiple of 3. Color the coins in 3 colors periodically: 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, ..., 1, 2, 3. The coins of some color $c$ have total value at most $1/3$ of the total sum. We claim that Ana can force Maria to take a coin colored $c$ on every move, which will imply that Ana can ensure at least $2/3$ of the total amount for herself.\n\nIndeed, let $c=1$; then Ana takes the last coin 3 first, then the last coin 2 in the new sequence. Thus Maria must move at a sequence 1, 2, 3, ..., 2, 3, 1, so she has to take a coin 1. Moreover each of her two possible moves yields a sequence either starting or ending with 2, 3. Ana can take these consecutive coins 2, 3 on her next move, thus obtaining a sequence of the kind 1, 2, 3, ..., 2, 3, 1, again. By following the same strategy Ana can ensure that Maria takes away all coin 1, as needed. If $c=2$ Ana takes the first coin 1 and the last coin 3, obtaining 2, 3, 1, ..., 3, 1, 2. Now any move of Maria is 2 and leaves a sequence either starting or ending with 3, 1. Ana removes such two consecutive coins and obtains 2, 3, 1, ..., 3, 1, 2 again. So the pattern repeats: Ana makes sure that takes away all coins 1 and 3.\n\nThe case $c=3$ is completely analogous. here Ana takes the first two coins 1, 2, in succession, yielding a sequence 3, 1, 2, ..., 1, 2, 3. Maria is forced to take a coin 3, after which Ana can restore the pattern 3, 1, 2, ..., 1, 2, 3 by taking two consecutive 1, 2 from an extreme.\n\nLet $n=1 \\pmod{3}$. Color the coins periodically\n\n$$\n1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, \\dots, 1, 2, 3, 1. \\qquad (1)\n$$\n\nSuppose that all coins 1 are 5 cents and all remaining ones are 1 peso. Then Maria can force Ana to take all coins 1, so that Ana will have less than $2/3$ of the total amount (this is easy to check). If Ana takes two consecutive coins from one extreme of (1), Maria takes the third coin from the same extreme; it is a 2 or a 3. The same pattern (1) occurs. If Ana takes the two extremal 1's in (1), Maria takes the first coin 2 in the resulting sequence. This gives\n\n$$\n3, 1, 2, 3, \\dots, 1, 2, 3. \\qquad (2)\n$$\n\nThere are three cases depending on Ana's next move. (a) If Ana takes two coins from the left extreme of (2), Maria takes the coin 2 following them and (2) occurs again. (b) If Ana takes two coins 2, 3 from the right extreme of (2), Maria takes the first coin 3 and (1) occurs again. (c) If Ana takes one coin of each extreme of (2). The resulting sequence ends in a 2. Maria takes this 2 and obtains (1).\n\nThus Maria ensures that one of the patterns (1) or (2) occurs after each combined move of the two. Eventually the sequence will become 1, 2, 3, 1 or 3, 1, 2, 3. In both cases Maria can make sure that Ana gets the remaining coin(s) 1.\n\n**Comment.** The case $n=2 \\pmod{3}$ is analogous to $n=1 \\pmod{3}$: Ana cannot succeed with certainty. Here we need the assumption $n \\ge 8$ for an analogous proof (a bit simpler).",

For part a), the only number that can be determined with certainty is $k$, the one in the middle. To find $k$, ignore a card with an unknown number $x$ on it, thus forming a set of $2k-2$ cards,\n\nand ask about their average. It is an integer if and only if $2k-2$ divides $S-x=k(2k-1)-x=k(2k-2)+(k-x)$, i.e. if and only if $2k-2$ divides $k-x$. Now $1 \\le x \\le 2k-1$ gives $|k-x| \\le k-1 < 2k-2$ (by $k \\ge 2$), thus $x=k$ is the only possibility. Hence applying the procedure to each card will exhibit $k$.\n\nConversely, suppose that the card with a number $m$ can be determined with certainty by asking a sequence of questions. Imagine that the number $j$ on each card is replaced by $2k-j$; the numbers $1, 2, \\dots, 2k-1$ are written on the cards again. Now ask the same sequence of questions. Since the average of $2k-j, \\dots, 2k-j_s$ is integer if and only if the average of $j_1, \\dots, j_s$ is, the answers will be the same as with the initial situation. Hence the questions that initially find the card with $m$ will find the card with $2k-m$ in the new situation; so $2k-m=m$ and $m=k$. This completes a).\n\nb) Let the cards be divided into groups so that the contents of each group as a whole is known. Since $k$ is the unique number that can be found with certainty, all groups contain at least 2 cards each except possibly one, which contains the card with $k$ and has size 1. It follows that the number of groups is at most $\\frac{1}{2}((2k-1)-1)+1=k$. We prove that $k$ groups can be obtained. More precisely, excluding the card with $k$, the remaining cards can be divided into $k-1$ pairs such that each pair contains numbers of the form $j, 2k-j$, $j=1, \\dots, k-1$. Call such cards complementary.\n\nNote that, once $k$ is found, one can determine the parity of the number on each card. Let e. g. $k$ be odd. Choose any card $x$ and ask about the two cards $k, x$. If their average is an integer then $x$ is odd, otherwise is even. The case of even $k$ is analogous.\n\nLet us show now how to find the complementary pairs $C_j = \\{j, 2k-j\\}$, $j=1, \\dots, k-1$. Start with $C_1 = \\{1, 2k-1\\}$ and $C_2 = \\{2, 2k-2\\}$. Take a pair of cards with different parity and unknown sum $y$; $y$ is odd. Ask about the average of the remaining $2k-3$ cards. It is an integer if and only if $2k-3$ divides $S-y=k(2k-1)-y=k(2k-3)+2k-y$, hence if and only if $2k-3$ divides $2k-y$. Note that $3 \\le y \\le 4k-3$, yielding $|2k-y| \\le 2k-3$. So the answer is yes if and only if $2k-y \\in \\{0, \\pm(2k-3)\\}$. Because $2k-y$ is odd (as $y$ is), we obtain $2k-y = \\pm(2k-3)$, yielding $y=3$ or $y=4k-3$. These are the extremal values of the sum $y$; they are achieved only if the numbers in the pair are 1, 2 or $2k-2, 2k-1$ respectively.\n\nBy repeating this procedure with all pairs of cards with different parity we find the two pairs 1, 2 and $2k-2, 2k-1$ (without knowing which one is which). Thus a group containing the 4 cards $1, 2, 2k-2, 2k-1$ is determined. It has 2 odd and 2 even numbers, and the parity of the number on each card is known. Hence the two odd cards in the group form the complementary pair $C_1 = \\{1, 2k-1\\}$, the two even cards form $C_2 = \\{2, 2k-2\\}$.\n\nSuppose that the complementary pairs $C_1, \\dots, C_{2j}$ are determined for some $j$ such that $2j \\le k-1$. We show how to find $C_{2j+1}$ and $C_{2j+2}$. One may assume $2j \\le k-3$. Indeed if $2j=k-1$ (with $k$ odd) then all complementary pairs are already found. If $2j=k-2$ (with $k$ even) then there is only 1 complementary pair left, $C_{k-1}$. But once $C_1, \\dots, C_{k-2}$ are known, so is $C_{k-1}$.\n\nExclude the $4j$ numbers $C_1, \\dots, C_{2j}$. There remain $2k-4j-1$ numbers with sum $S-4jk$. Again take a pair of cards with different parity and unknown odd sum $y$; note that $4j+3 \\le y \\le 4k-4j-3$. Like before ask about the average of the remaining $2k-4j-3$ cards. It is an integer if and only if $2k-4j-3$ divides $(S-4jk)-y=k(2k-1)-4jk-y=k(2k-4j-3)+(2k-y)$, i.e. if and only if $2k-4j-3$ divides $2k-y$. Now $4j+3 \\le y \\le 4k-4j-3$ gives $|2k-y| \\le 2k-4j-3$. So the answer is yes if and only if $2k-y \\in \\{0, \\pm(2k-4j-3)\\}$. Because $2k-y$ is odd, we obtain $2k-y = \\pm(2k-4j-3)$, yielding $y=4j+3$ or $y=4k-4j-3$. These are the extremal values of $y$,\n\nachieved only if the numbers in the pair are $2j+1, 2j+2, 2k-2j-2, 2k-2j-1$ respectively. Hence the procedure applied to all pairs of the kind considered, yields a group containing the 4 cards $2j+1, 2j+2, 2k-2j-2, 2k-2j-1$. The two odd cards in the group form the complementary pair $C_{2j+1} = \\{2j+1, 2k-2j-1\\}$, the two even ones form $C_{2j+2} = \\{2j+2, 2k-2j-2\\}$.\n\nWe presented an inductive argument which divides all cards different from $k$ into complementary pairs. This completes the solution.\n\n**Comment.** If the content of only one card different from $k$ is known, then all numbers can be found with certainty.",

Note that replacing an $x_i = -1$ by $x_i = 1$ does not change the mod 4 remainder of $S = \\sum_{j=1}^k x_jx_{j+1}$. Indeed the new and the old value of $S$ differ by $2(x_{i-1} + x_{i+1})$ which is a multiple of 4 as $x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}$ are odd. So we may assume $x_i = 1$ for all $i$, then $S=k$ and (*) is obvious.\n\nLet $d_1d_2\\dots d_{2013}$ satisfy the stated conditions. By (*) we have $\\sum_{j=1}^{1810} d_jd_{i+1} \\equiv 1810 \\pmod 4$ (here $d_{1810+1} = d_1$), hence $\\sum_{j=1}^{1809} d_jd_{i+1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ if and only if $1810 - d_{1810}d_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, i.e. $d_i d_{1810} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\n\nSimilarly $\\sum_{j=1810}^{2012} d_j d_{j+1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ if and only if $(2013-1809) - d_{1810} d_{2013} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, i.e.\n$d_{1810} d_{2013} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{4}$. We see that the conditions depend only on the three digits $d_1, d_{1810}, d_{2013}$; the remaining 2010 digits $d_i$ can be chosen arbitrarily among 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.\nThere are 3 odd decimal digits $\\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, namely 1, 5, 9; there are 2 odd digits $\\equiv -1 \\pmod{4}$, namely 3, 7.

So there are 3 choices for each of $d_1$ and $d_{1810}$, and 2 choices for $d_{2013}$. The choices are independent, which gives $3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 18$ admissible choices for the triple $d_1, d_{1810}, d_{2013}$.\nBecause there are 5 choices for each of the remaining 2010 digits $d_i$ (they can be arbitrary), we obtain $18 \\cdot 5^{2010}$ admissible numbers $d_1 d_2 \\dots d_{2013}$ with $d_{1810} \\in \\{1,5,9\\}$.\nLikewise if $d_{1810} \\in \\{3,7\\}$ then $d_1 \\in \\{3,7\\}$, $d_{2013} \\in \\{1,5,9\\}$. Thus there are 2 choices for each of $d_1$ and $d_{1810}$, and 3 choices for $d_{2013}$, leading to $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 12$ admissible choices for the triple $d_1, d_{1810}, d_{2013}$.\nLike in the previous case we obtain $12 \\cdot 5^{2010}$ admissible numbers with $d_{1810} \\in \\{3,7\\}$.\nIn summary there are $18 \\cdot 5^{2010} + 12 \\cdot 5^{2010} = 6 \\cdot 5^{2011}$ admissible numbers in all.",

Since each $a_i$ enters exactly two of these sums, we obtain $6S = 2(1+2+\\dots+12)$, $S = 26$. Thus the 4 numbers on each segment have sum 26.\n\nLet $T = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} a_i$, $U = \\sum_{i=7}^{12} a_i$. Add up the numbers on segments $a_1a_2, a_2a_3, a_3a_4$ to obtain $2(a_1+a_2+a_3)+U = 3S$. Likewise, $2(a_4+a_5+a_6)+U = 3S$, implying $a_1+a_2+a_3 = a_4+a_5+a_6$. In particular the sum T is even.\n\nThe least possible values of $a_1, \\dots, a_6$ are 1, \\dots, 6. Their sum $1+\\dots+6=21$ is odd, so $T \\neq 21$ and hence $T \\ge 22$. We show that $T=22$ is not possible either.\n\nSuppose that $T=22$. Then it is immediate that $a_1, \\dots, a_6$ are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 in some order. These numbers must be divided into two triples $a_1, a_2, a_3$ and $a_4, a_5, a_6$ with the same sum 11. Each triple must have an odd number of odd numbers, yielding the unique possible division: 1, 3, 7 and 2, 4, 5. By symmetry let $\\{a_1, a_2, a_3\\} = \\{1, 3, 7\\}$, $\\{a_4, a_5, a_6\\} = \\{2, 4, 5\\}$. Since $S=26$, it follows that the sums $a_7+a_8, a_9+a_{10}, a_{11}+a_{12}$ are even, and so is exactly one of the sums $a_8+a_9, a_{10}+a_{11}, a_{12}+a_7$. In all there are exactly two odd sums among $a_7+a_8, a_9+a_{10}, a_{11}+a_{12}, a_{13}+a_{14}, a_{15}+a_7$. They are among $a_8+a_9, a_{10}+a_{11}, a_{12}+a_7$, and the two summand in each one lie in a side of triangle $a_5a_6a_7$.\n\nOn the other hand, $a_7, \\dots, a_{12}$ are 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 in some order. There are 2 odd numbers among them, 9 and 11. They must be at consecutive vertices of the hexagon $a_7a_8\\dots a_{12}$. Otherwise each one has two even neighbors and there are 4 odd sums $a_i+a_{i+1}$, $i=7, 8, \\dots, 12$. Hence a side of triangle $a_1a_2a_3$ or triangle $a_4a_5a_6$ contains 9 and 11. The second case is impossible or else there will be odd sums $a_i+a_{i+1}$ on the sides of $a_1a_2a_3$. Hence 9 and 11 are on a side of $a_1a_2a_3$. Then $S=26$ implies that at the endpoints of this side we have numbers with sum $26-(9+11)=6$. However there are no two numbers with sum 6 in the triple 1, 3, 7.\n\nTherefore $T=22$ cannot occur, so that $T \\ge 24$. An example with $T=24$ is given in the figure. The required minimum is 24.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/3._NATIONAL_XXX_OMA_2013_p1_data_444fefe8b2.png)",

Note that the 9 grams coin A and the 11 grams coin B cannot be on the same pan as their positions are consecutive, hence of different parity.\n\nIf there is equilibrium we claim that, moreover, neither A nor B is on the pans, i.e. they are at positions 19 and 20. Indeed suppose that A or B is on one of the pans. Equilibrium is impossible with exactly one exceptional coin; the other one must be on a pan too. Moreover for equilibrium both of them must be on the same pan; however we remarked that this is not so. Thus A and B are at\npositions 19 and 20, and since B is the right neighbor of A, we find that the 11 grams coin is the last one.

Hence $G_1$ is lighter only if $B \\in G_2$. So B is at even position 2, 4, ..., 18.

More generally Ana can complete her task if $n=0 \\pmod{3}$ ($n \\ge 3$), and Maria can prevent her from doing so if $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$ ($n \\ge 4$).\n\nLet $n$ be a multiple of 3. Color the coins in 3 colors periodically: 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, ..., 1, 2, 3. The coins of some color $c$ have total value at most $1/3$ of the total sum. We claim that Ana can force Maria to take a coin colored $c$ on every move, which will imply that Ana can ensure at least $2/3$ of the total amount for herself.\n\nIndeed, let $c=1$; then Ana takes the last coin 3 first, then the last coin 2 in the new sequence. Thus Maria must move at a sequence 1, 2, 3, ..., 2, 3, 1, so she has to take a coin 1. Moreover each of her two possible moves yields a sequence either starting or ending with 2, 3. Ana can take these consecutive coins 2, 3 on her next move, thus obtaining a sequence of the kind 1, 2, 3, ..., 2, 3, 1, again. By following the same strategy Ana can ensure that Maria takes away all coin 1, as needed. If $c=2$ Ana takes the first coin 1 and the last coin 3, obtaining 2, 3, 1, ..., 3, 1, 2. Now any move of Maria is 2 and leaves a sequence either starting or ending with 3, 1. Ana removes such two consecutive coins and obtains 2, 3, 1, ..., 3, 1, 2 again. So the pattern repeats: Ana makes sure that takes away all coins 1 and 3.\n\nThe case $c=3$ is completely analogous. here Ana takes the first two coins 1, 2, in succession, yielding a sequence 3, 1, 2, ..., 1, 2, 3. Maria is forced to take a coin 3, after which Ana can restore the pattern 3, 1, 2, ..., 1, 2, 3 by taking two consecutive 1, 2 from an extreme.\n\nLet $n=1 \\pmod{3}$. Color the coins periodically\n\n$$\n1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, \\dots, 1, 2, 3, 1. \\qquad (1)\n$$\n\nSuppose that all coins 1 are 5 cents and all remaining ones are 1 peso. Then Maria can force Ana to take all coins 1, so that Ana will have less than $2/3$ of the total amount (this is easy to check). If Ana takes two consecutive coins from one extreme of (1), Maria takes the third coin from the same extreme; it is a 2 or a 3. The same pattern (1) occurs. If Ana takes the two extremal 1's in (1), Maria takes the first coin 2 in the resulting sequence. This gives\n\n$$\n3, 1, 2, 3, \\dots, 1, 2, 3. \\qquad (2)\n$$\n\nThere are three cases depending on Ana's next move. (a) If Ana takes two coins from the left extreme of (2), Maria takes the coin 2 following them and (2) occurs again. (b) If Ana takes two coins 2, 3 from the right extreme of (2), Maria takes the first coin 3 and (1) occurs again. (c) If Ana takes one coin of each extreme of (2). The resulting sequence ends in a 2. Maria takes this 2 and obtains (1).\n\nThus Maria ensures that one of the patterns (1) or (2) occurs after each combined move of the two. Eventually the sequence will become 1, 2, 3, 1 or 3, 1, 2, 3. In both cases Maria can make sure that Ana gets the remaining coin(s) 1.\n\n**Comment.** The case $n=2 \\pmod{3}$ is analogous to $n=1 \\pmod{3}$: Ana cannot succeed with certainty. Here we need the assumption $n \\ge 8$ for an analogous proof (a bit simpler).",

For part a), the only number that can be determined with certainty is $k$, the one in the middle. To find $k$, ignore a card with an unknown number $x$ on it, thus forming a set of $2k-2$ cards, and ask about their average. It is an integer if and only if $2k-2$ divides $S-x = k(2k-1)-x = k(2k-2)+(k-x)$, i.e. if and only if $2k-2$ divides $k-x$. Now $1 \\le x \\le 2k-1$ gives $|k-x| \\le k-1 < 2k-2$ (by $k \\ge 2$), thus $x=k$ is the only possibility. Hence applying the procedure to each card will exhibit $k$.\n\nConversely, suppose that the card with a number $m$ can be determined with certainty by asking a sequence of questions. Imagine that the number $j$ on each card is replaced by $2k-j$; the numbers $1, 2, ..., 2k-1$ are written on the cards again. Now ask the same sequence of questions. Since the average of $2k-j, ..., 2k-j$, is integer if and only if the average of $j_1, ..., j_n$ is, the answers will be the same as with the initial situation. Hence the questions that initially find the card with $m$ will find the card with $2k-m$ in the new situation; so $2k-m=m$ and $m=k$. This completes a).\n\nb) Let the cards be divided into groups so that the contents of each group as a whole is known. Since $k$ is the unique number that can be found with certainty, all groups contain at least 2 cards each except possibly one, which contains the card with $k$ and has size 1. It follows that the number of groups is at most $\\frac{1}{2} ((2k-1)-1)+1=k$. We prove that $k$ groups can be obtained. More precisely, excluding the card with $k$, the remaining cards can be divided into $k-1$ pairs such that each pair contains numbers of the form $j, 2k-j$, $j=1, ..., k-1$. Call such cards complementary.\n\nNote that, once $k$ is found, one can determine the parity of the number on each card. Let e. g. $k$ be odd. Choose any card $x$ and ask about the two cards $k, x$. If their average is an integer then $x$ is odd, otherwise is even. The case of even $k$ is analogous.\n\nLet us show now how to find the complementary pairs $C_j = \\{j, 2k-j\\}$, $j=1, ..., k-1$. Start with $C_1 = \\{1, 2k-1\\}$ and $C_2 = \\{2, 2k-2\\}$. Take a pair of cards with different parity and unknown sum $y$; $y$ is odd. Ask about the average of the remaining $2k-3$ cards. It is an integer if and only if $2k-3$ divides $S-y = k(2k-1)-y = k(2k-3)+2k-y$, hence if and only if $2k-3$ divides $2k-y$. Note that $3 \\le y \\le 4k-3$, yielding $|2k-y| \\le 2k-3$. So the answer is yes if and only if $2k-y \\in \\{0, \\pm(2k-3)\\}$. Because $2k-y$ is odd (as $y$ is), we obtain $2k-y=\\pm(2k-3)$, yielding $y=3$ or $y=4k-3$. These are the extremal values of the sum $y$; they are achieved only if the numbers in the pair are $1, 2$ or $2k-2, 2k-1$ respectively.\n\nBy repeating this procedure with all pairs of cards with different parity we find the two pairs $1, 2$ and $2k-2, 2k-1$ (without knowing which one is which). Thus a group containing the 4 cards $1, 2, 2k-2, 2k-1$ is determined. It has 2 odd and 2 even numbers, and the parity of the number on each card is known. Hence the two odd cards in the group form the complementary pair $C_1 = \\{1, 2k-1\\}$, the two even cards form $C_2 = \\{2, 2k-2\\}$.\n\nSuppose that the complementary pairs $C_1, ..., C_{2j}$ are determined for some $j$ such that $2j \\le k-1$. We show how to find $C_{2j+1}$ and $C_{2j+2}$. One may assume $2j \\le k-3$. Indeed if $2j=k-1$ (with $k$ odd) then all complementary pairs are already found. If $2j=k-2$ (with $k$ even) then there is only 1 complementary pair left, $C_{k-1}$. But once $C_{k-1}, ..., C_{k-2}$ are known, so is $C_{k-1}$.\n\nExclude the $4j$ numbers $C_1, ..., C_{2j}$. There remain $2k-4j-1$ numbers with sum $S-4jk$. Again take a pair of cards with different parity and unknown odd sum $y$; note that $4j+3 \\le y \\le 4k-4j-3$. Like before ask about the average of the remaining $2k-4j-3$ cards. It is an integer if and only if $2k-4j-3$ divides $(S-4jk)-y = k(2k-1)-4jk-y = k(2k-4j-3)+(2k-y)$, i.e, if and only if $2k-4j-3$ divides $2k-y$. Now $4j+3 \\le y \\le 4k-4j-3$ gives $|2k-y| \\le 2k-4j-3$. So the answer is yes if and only if $2k-y \\in \\{0, \\pm(2k-4j-3)\\}$. Because $2k-y$ is odd, we obtain $2k-y=\\pm(2k-4j-3)$, yielding $y=4j+3$ or $y=4k-4j-3$. These are the extremal values of $y$, achieved only if the numbers in the pair are $2j+1, 2j+2$ or $2k-2j-2, 2k-2j-1$ respectively.\n\nHence the procedure applied to all pairs of the kind considered, yields a group containing the 4 cards $2j+1, 2j+2, 2k-2j-2, 2k-2j-1$. The two odd cards in the group form the complementary pair $C_{2j+1} = \\{2j+1, 2k-2j-1\\}$, the two even ones form $C_{2j+2} = \\{2j+2, 2k-2j-2\\}$.\n\nWe presented an inductive argument which divides all cards different from $k$ into complementary pairs. This completes the solution.\n\nComment. If the content of only one card different from $k$ is known, then all numbers can be found with certainty.",

To justify $(*)$ reduce the $x_i$ mod 4; then they become $+1$'s or $-1$'s as odd numbers are congruent to $\\pm 1$ mod 4. Note that replacing an $x_i = -1$ by $x_i = 1$ does not change the mod 4 remainder of $S = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} x_j x_{j+1}$. Indeed the new and the old value of $S$ differ by $2(x_{i-1} + x_{i+1})$ which is a multiple of 4 as $x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}$ are odd. So we may assume $x_i = 1$ for all $i$, then $S = k$ and $(*)$ is obvious.\nLet $d_1 d_2 \\dots d_{2013}$ satisfy the stated conditions. By $(*)$ we have $\\sum_{j=1}^{1810} d_j d_{j+1} \\equiv 1810 \\pmod{4}$ (here $d_{1810}+1 = d_1$), hence $\\sum_{j=1}^{1809} d_j d_{j+1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ if and only if $1810 - d_{1810} d_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, i.e. $d_1 d_{1810} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\nSimilarly $\\sum_{j=1810}^{2012} d_j d_{j+1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ if and only if $(2013-1809) - d_{1810} d_{2013} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, i.e. $d_{1810} d_{2013} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{4}$. We see that the conditions depend only on the three digits $d_1, d_{1810}, d_{2013}$; the remaining 2010 digits $d_i$ can be chosen arbitrarily among 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.\nThere are 3 odd decimal digits $\\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, namely 1, 5, 9; there are 2 odd digits $\\equiv -1 \\pmod{4}$, namely 3, 7. Let $d_{1810} \\in \\{1,5,9\\}$. Then $d_1 d_{1810} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ and $d_{1810} d_{2013} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{4}$ imply $d_1 \\in \\{1,5,9\\}, d_{2013} \\in \\{3,7\\}$. So there are 3 choices for each of $d_1$ and $d_{1810}$, and 2 choices for $d_{2013}$. The choices are independent, which gives $3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 18$ admissible choices for the triple $d_1, d_{1810}, d_{2013}$. Because there are 5 choices for each of the remaining 2010 digits $d_i$ (they can be arbitrary), we obtain $18 \\cdot 5^{2010}$ admissible numbers $d_1 d_2 \\dots d_{2013}$ with $d_{1810} \\in \\{1,5,9\\}$.\nLikewise if $d_{1810} \\in \\{3,7\\}$ then $d_1 \\in \\{3,7\\}$, $d_{2013} \\in \\{1,5,9\\}$. Thus there are 2 choices for each of $d_1$ and $d_{1810}$, and 3 choices for $d_{2013}$, leading to $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 12$ admissible choices for the triple $d_1, d_{1810}, d_{2013}$. Like in the previous case we obtain $12 \\cdot 5^{2010}$ admissible numbers with $d_{1810} \\in \\{3,7\\}$.\nIn summary there are $18 \\cdot 5^{2010} + 12 \\cdot 5^{2010} = 6 \\cdot 5^{2011}$ admissible numbers in all.",

If $a$ is a 1-digit number then $a = (a - 1) + 1$ is the desired representation since $a - 1$ and 1 are 1-digit numbers, hence type 2 numbers by definition. Let $a$ have at least two digits. Write it in the form $a = u_1v_1u_2v_2u_3v_3...$ where $u_1, u_2, ...$ and $v_1, v_2, ...$ are its digits at odd and even position respectively. We have $u_1 > 0$ for the first digit $u_1$, also $v_1 \\ge u_1 > 0$ since $a$ is of type 1. Now let $b = u_10u_20u_30...$ be the number obtained by replacing all digits at even positions by 0. This is a type 2 number because $u_i \\ge 0$ for all i. Next, construct number $c$ as follows: delete the first digit $u_1$ from $a$, then replace all remaining digits $u_2, u_3, ...$ at odd positions by zeros. In other words $c = v_10v_20v_30...$; the first digit $v_1$ is nonzero. Clearly $c$ is also of type 2, and it has one digit less than $b$ (and a). Now it follows from the rule of addition that $a = b + c$, so part a) is done.\n\nFor part b) we show that the type 2 number 109 is not representable as the sum of two type 1 numbers. Suppose on the contrary that such a representation exists. If one summand is among 1, ..., 9 then the other is among 100, ..., 108, and the latter numbers are not of type 1. So let both summands be 2-digit numbers, and let $10u+v$ be one of them, with $0 < u \\le v \\le 9$ as $10u+v$ is of type 1. The other summand is then $b = 109 - (10u+v) = 10(10-u) + (9-v)$. Because $1 \\le 10-u \\le 9$ and $0 \\le 9-v \\le 8$, the digits of b are $10-u$ and $9-v$ in this order.

To prove this, we first show that the least $n$ for which 1226 triminos 1\\times 3 can be placed on an $n \\times n$ square without common points (including vertices) is $n=99$. Next, take a 99\\times 99 square. In its first row one can place 25 triminos without point in common; they leave uncovered the 24 cells whose position numbers are divisible by 4. Do the same with all odd-numbered rows 1, 3, 5, ..., 99, of which there are 50. This arrangement of 25\\cdot 50 = 1250 triminos satisfies the conditions and, clearly, any greater grid square can accommodate 1250 trimino too.\n\nSo let $Q$ be an $n \\times n$ square containing 1226 triminos 1\\times 3 without common points (including vertices). Extend $Q$ to an $(n+1) \\times (n+1)$ square $Q'$ by adjoining an additional bottom row and additional leftmost column, with $n+1$ cells in each of them. To each trimino $T$ add 5 cells to the left and under it so that $T$ and these 5 cells form a rectangle $R(T)$ with dimensions 2\\times 4. The definition of $R(T)$ is illustrated in the figures, for horizontal and vertical triminos.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Argentina_2015_Booklet_p4_data_eb6b5133ac.png)\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Argentina_2015_Booklet_p4_data_5c7e283253.png)\n\nThe 2\\times 4 rectangles defined in this way may stick out of $Q$ but are contained in the bigger square $Q'$.\n\nThe point of the construction is that the rectangles $R(T)$ do not overlap, i. e., no two of them have cells in common. Indeed, let $T$ and $T'$ be arbitrary triminos. By symmetry assume that $T$ is vertical. Enclose it in a 3\\times 5 rectangle as shown in the figure.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Argentina_2015_Booklet_p5_data_4caeb8d7d8.png)\n\nNote that by hypothesis this rectangle $R^*$ contains no cell of the trimino $T'$. The cells marked with \\textbullet\\ form the rectangle $R(T)$ together with $T$. Denote by $C$ the top right cell in $T'$; it is also the top right cell of $R(T')$.\n\nSuppose that $C$ is under line $a$. Then so is the entire rectangle $R(T')$ by its definition, hence $R(T')$ does not overlap with $R(T)$. The same follows if $C$ is to the left of line $c$. Suppose that $C$ is in region I, i. e., between the lines $c, d$ and above line $b$. Then the entire $T'$ is above $b$. This is clear if $T'$ is horizontal. And if $T'$ is vertical then having cells under $b$ mean having cells in $R^*$ which is forbidden. So indeed the whole of $T'$ is above $b$, implying that $R(T')$ is above line $b'$. Then $R(T')$ does not overlap $R(T)$ again. The case where $C$ is in region II is analogous; here $T'$ is to the right of line $d$ and $R(T')$ is to the right of line $d'$. Finally the case of $C$ in region III is obvious.\n\nIn summary, we obtain 1226 non-overlapping rectangles $2 \\times 4$ in the $(n+1) \\times (n+1)$ square $Q'$. By area considerations then $(n+1)^2 \\ge 8 \\cdot 1226 = 9808$ and so $n+1 \\ge \\sqrt{9808} = 99,035...$. It follows that $n \\ge 99$, as stated, so the starting discussion completes the proof.",

This is true for $k=0,1$ since clearly $f(a,b,c) \\ge 3$ for all $a,b,c \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Suppose that $f(a,b,c) = 2^k$ with $k \\ge 2$. Consider the least $k$ with this property. Observe that at least two numbers among $a, b, c$ are even. Otherwise $f(a,b,c)$ is odd while $2^k$ is even. If $a, b, c$ are all even, they can be divided by 2 to yield $f(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{b}{2}, \\frac{c}{2}) = 2^{k-1}$, which contradicts the minimality of $k$. Hence one may assume that $a, b$ are even and $c$ is odd. Here $[a,b] = 2[\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{b}{2}]$. Note also that\\n\\n$$\\n[a,c] = 2\\left[\\frac{a}{2}, c\\right] \\text{ holds because } a \\text{ is even and } c \\text{ is odd.}\\n$$\\n\\nAnalogously $[b,c] = 2[\\frac{b}{2}, c]$.

If $a=3$, $b=5$, A's first move is forced to be adding 1 to one of the numbers because they are both primes. If A adds it to 3 then B adds 1 to the obtained 4 and obtains 5, 5. And if A adds 1 to 5 the new pair is 3, 6. Since 3 is a proper divisor of 6, B can add it to 3 and obtain 6, 6. Hence in part b) A can obtain two equal numbers with his first move; B can achieve the same with his first move in part a). Note that no one can win in one move in positions a, a where $a=5, 6, 7$. Now it suffices to show that any position with two equal numbers $a, a'$, where $a \\le \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 2014$, is losing, i. e., the player $X$ to move in this position loses.

Now the strategy of the opponent $Y$ is as follows. If one of $a$ and $a'$ has a proper divisor $d'$ such that $a'+d' \\ge 2015$, $Y$ adds $d'$ to $a'$ and wins. If not, $Y$ repeats the previous move of $X$, adding $d$ to $a$; note that this is possible. This yields a new pair $a', a'$, of equal numbers, with $a' > a$. Observe that now $X$ cannot reach 2015 in one move, otherwise $Y$ would have done so on his previous move. Hence $X$ has to obtain again a pair of different numbers $a', a''$, with $a' < a'' \\le 2014$. Then $Y$ repeats the same: he either reaches 2015 in one move if this is possible, or obtains the pair $a'', a''$ from which $X$ cannot win in one move. If $Y$ follows this strategy, the numbers $a, a', a'', \\dots$ in the process increase, and $X$ never makes a winning move.

Apparently R takes A to B and also $R(E') = F'$ for each rotated position $OE'F'$ of the initial right isosceles triangle OEF. Hence R takes line AE' to line BF'. The angle between a line and its image under any rotation equals the angle of rotation, hence AE' and BF' are perpendicular. In other words $\\hat{APB} = 90^\\circ$, meaning that P lies on the circle with diameter AB, i.e., on the circle $\\alpha$ with center $(-1,1)$ and radius $\\sqrt{2}$. Naturally not every point $P \\in \\alpha$ can be obtained as the intersection of lines AE' and BF' for some rotated position OE'F' of OEF. A necessary condition is that line AP contains a point at distance 1 from the origin, point E'. Equivalently AP must have a common point with the circle $\\beta$ centered at (0, 0) and of radius 1.\n\nLet AT and AT' be the tangents from A to $\\beta$, with T in quadrant 2, T' in quadrant 3. Then each admissible line AP intersects the interior of $T\\hat{A}T'$ or coincides with one of AT and AT'. Let $AT \\cap \\alpha = P_0$, $AT' \\cap \\alpha = P'_0$. Then all admissible positions of P are contained in the closer minor arc $\\widehat{P_0P'_0} = \\gamma$ of circle $\\alpha$ (the arc not containing A and B). Note that $P_0$ is in quadrant 1. The entire $\\gamma$ is under the line through $P_0$ parallel to the x-axis. Hence the y-coordinate of an admissible point P does not exceed the y-coordinate $y_0$ of $P_0$. In fact $y_0$ is the desired maximum value because $P_0$ is admissible. Indeed let BU be the tangent to $\\beta$ from B, with U in quadrant 1. Rotations preserve tangency, so, given $R(A) = B$, rotation R takes tangent AT to tangent BU. This yields $T\\hat{O}U = 90^\\circ$ on the one hand, and $AT \\perp BU$ on the other. The latter means that AT and BU intersect on $\\alpha$, and since $P_0$ is defined by $AT \\cap \\alpha = P_0$, we\nfind $AT \\cap BU = P_0$. Hence $P_0$ is admissible, with $E' = T$, $F' = U$. (It follows from the computation below that P is obtained through a 60^\\circ-clockwise rotation of OEF about the origin.)\n\nIt remains to evaluate $y_0$, i. e., the length of the perpendicular $P_0H$ from $P_0$ to x-axis. Triangle OAT is right at T with $OA = 2$, $OT = 1$, therefore $O\\hat{A}T = 30^\\circ$. Hence the right triangle $AP_0H$ yields $y_0 = P_0H = \\frac{1}{2}AP_0$. Triangle ABP$_0$ is right at $P_0$ with $B\\hat{A}P_0 = 15^\\circ$. One expression for cos 15^\\circ is $\\cos 15^\\circ = \\frac{1}{4}(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{6})$. Replacing in $y_0 = \\frac{1}{2}AP_0 = \\frac{1}{2}AB \\cos 15^\\circ$ leads to the answer: $y_{max} = y_0 = \\frac{1}{2}(1+\\sqrt{3})$.\n\n**Remark.** Using cos 15^\\circ can be avoided by applying the following elementary fact: the hypotenuse of a 15^\\circ-75^\\circ-90^\\circ triangle is 4 times greater than its respective altitude. (*)\n\nLet the triangle ABC with $\\hat{C} = 90^\\circ$, $\\hat{B} = 15^\\circ$ and altitude $CH = h$. Take the midpoint M of AB. It is known that $MA = MB = MC$, so $C\\hat{M}H = M\\hat{B}C + M\\hat{C}B = 30^\\circ$. Thus triangle MCH is 30^\\circ-60^\\circ-90^\\circ, hence $MC = 2CH = 2h$ and $AB = 2MC = 4h$.\n\nThen the computation of $y_0$ can go as follows. Set $AP_0 = a$, $BP_0 = b$, $a > b$. The altitude from $P_0$ to AB in triangle ABP$_0$ equals $h = \\frac{AB}{4} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, by (*). Hence $ab = AB \\cdot h = 2\\text{área}(ABP_0) = 2\\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 2$. Since\n$$\na^2 + b^2 = (2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8, \\text{ we obtain } (a \\pm b)^2 = 8 \\pm 4. \\text{ Therefore}\n$$\n$$\na+b=2\\sqrt{3}, a-b=2 \\text{ and so } a=1+\\sqrt{3}, y_0=\\frac{1}{2}a=\\frac{1}{2}(1+\\sqrt{3})\n$$",

For list $i=1,2,3$ Alex announces the number $x_i$ of subsets in the list that contain N, and the ordered triple $x_1, x_2, x_3$ is the only information Bibi obtains. So being able to guess N with certainty means that each triple $x_1, x_2, x_3$ yields a certain $N \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 1001\\}$ as a solution. Because there are 1001 possible numbers N and Alex can choose any of them, it is then necessary that the number of different triples $x_1, x_2, x_3$ is at least 1001. This number equals $(a_1+1)(a_2+1)(a_3+1)$ as there are $a_i+1$ possible values of $x_i$,\nnamely $0,1,...,a_i(i=1,2,3)$. Hence we must have\n$(a_1+1)(a_2+1)(a_3+1) \\ge 1001$.\n\nNow use the AM-GM inequality to estimate the total number\n$a_1 + a_2 + a_3$ of subsets used by Bibi:\n\n$$\n1001 \\le (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1)(a_3 + 1) \\le \\left( \\frac{a_1 + a_2 + a_3}{3} + 1 \\right)^3\n$$\n\nIt follows from here that $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 \\ge 28$. Indeed if\n$a_1 + a_2 + a_3 \\le 27$ then the right-hand side of the displayed\ninequality is at most $\\left(\\frac{27}{3}+1\\right)^3 = 1000$.\n\nNow we show that 3 lists with a total of 28 sets suffice. Use the factorization $1001 = 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$, consider a $7 \\times 11 \\times 13$ parallelepiped with the numbers 1, 2, ..., 1001 written in its unit cubes. Let the vertical dimension be 13, then there are 13 horizontal layers of unit cubes (of dimensions $7 \\times 11$). For $i=1,2,...,12$ let $S_i$ be the union of the first $i$ horizontal layers. Let list 1 consist of the 12 sets $S_1, S_2, ..., S_{12}$, and let Alex say that $x_1$ of them contain $N$. Observe that this answer enables Bibi to determine the horizontal layer containing $N$, whatever the announced value $x_1 \\in \\{0,1,...,12\\}$. Indeed, since $S_1 \\subset S_2 \\subset ... \\subset S_{12}$, the answer $x_1 = 0$ means that $N$ is in layer 13, $x_1 = 1$ means that it is in layer 12, etc. In general $x_1 = i \\in \\{0,1,...,12\\}$ implies that $N$ is in horizontal layer $13-i$. Thus a list of 12 sets is enough to single out the necessary layer out of 13 possible ones. Analogous lists in the other two directions, with $7-1=6$ sets and $11-1=10$ sets, can determine the layers in those directions that contain $N$.\n\nAs a result $N$ becomes known with $12+6+10=28$ sets, with 3 lists used. If Bibi uses 2 lists with $a_1$ and $a_2$ sets then by the same reasoning it is necessary that\n\n$$\n1001 \\le (a_1+1)(a_2+1) \\le \\left(\\frac{a_1+a_2}{2}+1\\right)^2, \\text{ hence } a_1+a_2 \\ge 61.\n$$\n\nFinally it is clear that one list alone would require at least 1000 sets.",

Moreover this is true for any number of boxes.\n\nDenote by $x_n$ the number of markers in a certain box before step $n$, $n = 1, 2, \\dots$. Suppose that $x_n = n$ for some $n$. Then by the rule of adding markers we have $x_{n+1} = n+1$, $x_{n+2} = n+2$ etc.; in other words the number of markers in that box equals the number of the oncoming step $l$ for each $l \\ge n$. So, in order to prove that eventually all boxes contain the same number of markers, it is enough to show that for each box there exist a step $n$ such that $x_n = n$.\n\nWe use the following observation. Let a box *C* satisfy $x_i > l$ for some *l*, that is, the difference $d_i = x_i - l$ is positive. Then there is an *m* \\ge *l* such that *C* receives no marker at step *m*. Otherwise\n$x_i$ increases by 1 at every step $m \\ge l$, which means that $x_i + s$ is divisible by $l+s$ for all $s \\ge 0$.\n\nHowever this is impossible as $1 < \\frac{x_i + s}{l+s} < 2$ for $s$ sufficiently large; it is enough to take $s > x_i - 2l$.\n\nLet $m \\ge l$ be the first step that adds no marker to C. Then the observation implies that the difference $d_{m+1} = x_{m+1} - (m+1) = x_m - (m+1)$ satisfies $d_{m+1} = d_l - 1$. If $d_{m+1} > 0$ then by the same reason there is a step $k > m$ with $d_k = d_m - 1$. Repeated applications of the same argument show that after finitely many steps there will be a step $s$ such that $d_s = 0$, that is, $x_s = s$.\n\nInitially, before step 1, one has $x_1 \\ge 1$ for each box C. This is ensured by the condition that every box contains a marker. If $x_1 = 1$ then $x_n = n$ holds for C already with $n=1$. Otherwise $x_i > 1$, so by the above $x_n = n$ will result after finitely many steps.

The allowed operation is choosing a $k$-element subset of $B$ and increasing each of its elements by 1 modulo 1001.\n\nLet us show that a winning number $k$ is coprime with 1001. Assume on the contrary that $\\text{gcd}(k,1001) = d > 1$ and consider any set $B$ chosen by Bibi. Let the elements of $B$ have sum $S$. Suppose Alex chooses $k$ numbers from $B$ of which $m$ are 1000. Then the operation increases $S$ by $(k - m) - 1000m = k - 1001m$, a number divisible by $d$ in view of $\\text{gcd}(k,1001) = d$. Hence the operation does not change $S$ modulo $d$, for any choice of $B$. Let $B$ contain one number 1 and $|B|-1$ zeros. Then $S \\equiv 1 \\pmod{d}$ persists after each operation, while the desired \"all zeros\" final state requires $S \\equiv 0 \\pmod{d}$. The contradiction proves that $\\text{gcd}(k,1001) = 1$ is a necessary condition for $k$ to be winning.\n\nConversely, $\\text{gcd}(k, 1001) = 1$ is sufficient.

It is enough to show that there is a sequence of operations that adds 1 modulo 1001 to $b$ without affecting the remaining numbers in $B$.\n\nTake a $(k + 1)$-element subset $C$ of $B$ that contains $b$. This is possible as $|B| > k$. Apply the operation $l$ times to each $k$-element subset of $C$. Each element of $C$ is contained in exactly $k$ such subsets, so the procedure increases it $kl$ times modulo 1001. Because $kl \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1001}$, the result is that each element of $C$ is increased by 1 modulo 1001. Now take the $k$-element subset $C \\setminus \\{b\\}$ of $C$ and apply the operation 1000 times. After all described operations each element of $C \\setminus \\{b\\}$ is increased by $1+1000=1001$ modulo 1001 with respect to its initial state, meaning that the operations do not change it. Clearly the elements of $B \\setminus C$ do not change either. The only change concerns $b$ which is increased by 1 modulo 1001, as needed.

For clarity we state separately a fact used later in a proof of the lower bound $S(\\alpha) \\ge 2(1 + \\dots + k)$ for each permutation $\\alpha$ of 1, 2, ..., $3k + 1$.\n\n\\textbf{Claim.} If $2k$ distinct natural numbers are divided into $k$ pairs $u_j, v_j$ with $u_j < v_j$, $j = 1, \\dots, k$, then $v_1 + \\dots + v_k \\ge 2(1 + \\dots + k)$.\n\nThe justification is by induction on $k$, with obvious base case $k=1$.\n\nFor the inductive step $k-1 \\to k$ choose the labeling so that $v_k := \\max_{j=1}^k v_j$. Ignore $u_k$ and $v_k$ for the time being, and apply the inductive hypothesis to the remaining $2k-2$ numbers. This gives $v_1 + \\dots + v_{k-1} \\ge 2(1 + \\dots + (k-1))$. So it is enough to prove $v_k \\ge 2k$ in order to complete the inductive step. We have $v_k > v_j$ for all $j = 1, \\dots, k-1$ by $v_k = \\max_{j=1}^k v_j$. In addition observe that $v_k > u_j$ for all $j = 1, \\dots, k$. This holds for $j=k$ by hypothesis. Suppose that $v_k < u_j$ for some $j=1, \\dots, k-1$. Then $u_j < v_j$ implies $v_k < v_j$, which contradicts the maximum choice of $v_k$. In summary there are $2k-1$ distinct natural numbers smaller than $v_k$, namely $u_1, \\dots, u_k, v_1, \\dots, v_{k-1}$. Hence $v_k \\ge 2k$, completing the induction.\n\nNow let $\\alpha = (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{3k+1})$ be any permutation of 1, 2, ..., $3k + 1$. Divide $a_1, a_2, ..., a_{3k}$ into k triples $T_j = \\{a_{3j-2}, a_{3j-1}, a_{3j}\\}, j = 1, \\dots, k$. Let $u_j$ and $v_j$ be respectively the smaller number and the middle number in $T_j$. The $2k$ numbers $u_j, v_j, j = 1, \\dots, k$, are distinct. Then the claim above gives $v_1 + \\dots + v_k \\ge 2(1 + \\dots + k)$. Since $v_1, \\dots, v_k$ are marked numbers (in general there are more of them), the sum $S(\\alpha)$ of all marked number in $\\alpha$ also satisfies $S(\\alpha) \\ge 2(1 + \\dots + k)$.\n\nThe equality $S(\\alpha) = 2(1 + \\dots + k)$ is attained for the following permutation of 1, 2, ..., $3k + 1$: $3k + 1, 1, 2, 2k + 1, 4, 3, 2k + 2, 6, 5, 2k + 3, ..., 2k - 2, 2k - 3, 3k - 1, 2k, 2k - 1, 3k$.\n\nThe marked numbers are precisely 2, 4, ..., 2k, hence $S(\\alpha) = 2(1 + \\dots + k)$. This completes the proof of $S_{min} = 2(1 + \\dots + k) = k(k+1)$.",

Since 4 columns out of 8 can be chosen in $\\binom{8}{4}$ ways, there are $\\frac{1}{2}\\binom{8}{4}$ such partitions. Clearly the quadruples $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are different for different partitions. Observe also that in each partition at least one of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ is non-admissible. Indeed if $Q_1$, $Q_2$ are admissible then no column intersects their respective rows at 3 zeros, which contradicts a la condition\n\n(c). Hence the specified $\\frac{1}{2}\\binom{8}{4}$ partitions generate at least $\\frac{1}{2}\\binom{8}{4}$ no-admissible quadruples associated to the initial admissible quadruple Q. Because there are $n$ admissible quadruples, this argument yields a list of $l \\ge \\frac{1}{2}\\binom{8}{4}$ $n$ non-admissible quadruples. We are about to see that the repetitions in it are not too numerous.\n\nEach non-admissible quadruple $Q'$ on the list occurs in it as many times as there are admissible quadruples Q that generate $Q'$ in the way explained above. Every such Q occupies 4 columns among the 8 complementary columns of $Q'$, which gives at most $\\binom{8}{4}$ possibilities for Q.\n\nConsequently every no-admissible quadruple on the list occurs at most $\\binom{8}{4}$ times in it.\n\nGiven the length $l \\ge \\frac{1}{2}\\binom{8}{4}$ of the list and the maximum number $\\binom{8}{4}$ of repetitions of an item, we find at least $\\frac{n}{2}$ different no-admissible quadruple in T. The total number of quadruples of columns is $\\binom{12}{4} = 495$. Exactly $n$ of them are admissible and $495-n$ are non-admissible. Hence $495-n \\ge \\frac{n}{2}$, which yields the desired $n \\le 330$.",

We say that an arc $\\overarc{PQ}$ has start $P$ (o starts at $P$) if $Q$ can be reached from $P$ by going along the arc in counterclockwise direction.\n\nThe meaning of \"$\\overarc{PQ}$ has end $Q$ (or ends at $Q$)$\" is analogous.\n\nLet $\\gamma_1, \\dots, \\gamma_d$ be arcs on the circle with lengths 1, 2, ..., $d$ such none of them contains another.\n\nConsider the shortest arc $\\gamma_1 = \\overarc{AB}$, starting at $A$, and the longest one $\\gamma_d = \\overarc{CD}$, starting at $C$. Let $X$ be the set of black points on arc $\\overarc{BC}$ with start $B$, excluding its end $C$. Let $Y$ be the set of black points on arc $\\overarc{DA}$ with end $A$, excluding its start $D$. Finally let $Z$ be the set of black points on the closed arc $\\gamma_{d} = \\overarc{CD}$. Then each black point belongs to exactly one of $X$, $Y$ and $Z$.\n\nNow observe that every arc $\\gamma_m$ with $1 < m < d$ satisfies exactly one of the following conditions: (1) $\\gamma_m$ starts in $X$; (2) $\\gamma_m$ ends in $Y$. Clearly (1) and (2) do not hold simultaneously, otherwise $\\gamma_m$ contains arc $\\gamma_{ii} = \\overarc{CD}$. Suppose that (1) does not hold.

This completes the justification.\n\nLet there be $x$ arcs $\\gamma_m$ satisfying (1), $1 < m < d$. They start at different points of the set $X$, or else some of them contains another. Hence $x \\le |X|$. Analogously, if $y$ is the number of arcs $\\gamma_m$ satisfying\n\n(2), $1 < m < d$, then $y \\le |Y|$. By the reasoning above $x+y = d-2$, therefore $d-2 = x+y \\le |X|+|Y| = n-|Z| = n-d-1$. This gives the upper bound $d \\le \\lfloor \\frac{n+1}{2} \\rfloor$.\n\nFor odd $n=2k+1$ we have $\\lfloor \\frac{n+1}{2} \\rfloor = k+1$, and $d=k+1$ is admissible.

In conclusion the solution to the problem for $n=2k+1$ are the numbers 1, 2, ..., $k+1$, yielding 1, 2, ..., 500 as the answer to the original question.\n\nSimilarly, for even $n=2k$ we have $\\lfloor \\frac{n+1}{2} \\rfloor = k$, and $d=k$ is admissible. The example for $d=k$ is analogous. Label the black points 1, 2, ..., $2k$ in counterclockwise direction and consider $k$ arcs $\\gamma_1, \\dots, \\gamma_k$ with lengths 1, 2, ..., $k$.

The solution uses the remark that if $l \\in \\mathbb{N}$ is divisible by a prime $p$ but not by $p^2$ - in which case we say that $l$ is exactly divisible by $p$ - then $l$ is not a perfect power.\n\nStart a construction by choosing two primes $p$ and $q$ such that $n < p < q$. Consider the progression arithmetic progression $P$ with first term $p$, common difference $q-p$ and length $n$; its terms are $a_k = p+k(q-p)$, $k=0,1,\\dots,n-1$. Observe that $a_0 = p$ is the only term divisible by $p$. Indeed if $p$ divides $a_k$ with $k \\ge 1$ then $p$ divides $k$ or $q-p$. Both are impossible: Since $p$ is a prime, it divides neither $k$ (as $0 < k < n < p$) nor $q-p$ (as $q$ is a prime greater than $p$). Similarly $a_1 = q$ is the only term divisible by $q$. If $q$ divides $a_k$ with $k \\ge 2$ then $q$ divides $k-1$ or $p$. Neither one is possible as $q$ is prime and $0 < k-1 < n < q$, $p < q$. In addition $q$ does not divide $a_0 = p$ since $p < q$.\n\nNext, let $A = a_0 a_1 \\dots a_{n-1}$ be the product of the terms of $P$. By the above $A$ is exactly divisible by $p$ and $q$. Multiply each $a_k$ by $A$ to obtain a new progression $a_0 A, a_1 A, \\dots, a_{n-1} A$ of length $n$. The product of its terms $a_0 a_1 \\dots a_{n-1} A'' = A'^{n+1}$ is a perfect $(n+1)$-st power. Because $p$ divides $a_k$ only for $k=0$ and $A$ is exactly divisible by $p$, it follows that each of the terms $a_1 A, \\dots, a_{n-1} A$ is also exactly divisible by $p$, hence not a perfect power. Similarly, since $a_0 = p$ is not divisible by $q$ and $A$ is exactly divisible by $q$, the first term $a_0 A$ of the new progression is exactly divisible by $q$. So $a_0 A$ is not a perfect power, which completes the justification that the progression $a_0 A, a_1 A, \\dots, a_{n-1} A$ satisfies the given conditions.",

Call a row or column empty, incomplete or full at a certain moment of the game if it contain respectively 0, 1 or 2 marked cells. The strategy of Lucas has two stages.\n\n\\textbf{Stage 1:} The first move of Agustin has the following properties. It is in an empty row $R$ and an empty column $C$, and after it there are still empty rows left. Call such a move \\emph{standard}. The answer of Lucas to a standard move of Agustin is to choose an empty row $R' \\ne R$ and mark the intersection of $R'$ and column $C$. Such a \\emph{standard answer} is allowed by the rules, and it makes $C$ a full column; thus $C$ cannot be used later on. Let Lucas give standard answers as long as Agustin makes standard moves (at least Agustin's first move is standard). Observe that each column either empty or full after every standard answer of Lucas, hence Agustin's next move is in an empty column. Since there is a standard answer to any standard move, Lucas cannot lose if all of Agustin's moves are standard. Suppose then that Agustin makes non-standard moves, and let $M$ be the first one of them. As explained above, $M$ is in an empty column $C$. There are two possibilities: (1) $M$ is in an incomplete row $R$; (2) $M$ is in the last empty row remaining. In case (1) there are still empty rows left. Indeed each previous combined move of the two leaves an odd number of empty rows because $n$ is odd. So Lucas gives a standard answer again: taking an empty row $R' \\ne R$ and marking the intersection of $R'$ and column $C$. In case (2) all rows are incomplete after $M$. Here Lucas takes any row $R' \\ne R$ and marks the intersection of $R'$ and column $C$, thus making $R'$ full. This completes stage 1. As a result the table has the following properties:\n\n(i) The number $E$ of empty rows is even.\n\n(ii) The number $I$ of incomplete rows is even.\n\n(iii) There are no incomplete columns.\n\nIndeed $E$ is odd and $I$ is even after all moves before $M$, while the last combined move of the two decreases $E$ by 1 and does not change $I$, in both case 1 and 2. Hence (i) and (ii) hold. As for (iii), it holds after every move of Lucas so far.\n\n\\textbf{Stage 2:} Now Lucas makes sure that after each move of his properties (i) - (iii) are preserved. Let us justify that he can achieve this no matter how Agustin plays.\n\nLet Agustin make a move $M$ in row $R$ and column $C$, where $R$ is empty. Then $C$ was also empty before $M$. This is because by (iii) there were no incomplete columns before $M$, and one cannot move in a full column. So $M$ makes both $R$ and $C$ incomplete, in particular, by (i), $E$ is odd after $M$. Hence it is possible for Lucas to mark the intersection of one empty row $R' \\ne R$ and column $C$. This is a standard answer which makes $C$ full and $R'$ incomplete. Thus the combined move of Agustin and Lucas decreases $E$ by 2 and increases $I$ by 2. Hence (i) - (iii) are preserved after the answer of Lucas.\n\nSimilarly let Agustin make a move $M$ in row $R$ and column $C$ where $R$ is incomplete. As in the previous case, $C$ was empty before $M$. So $M$ makes $R$ full and $C$ incomplete. Then by (ii) $I$ is odd after $M$. Hence Lucas can mark the intersection of one incomplete row $R' \\ne R$ and column $C$,\n\nmaking both $R'$ and $C$ full. The combined move of Agustin and Lucas decreases $I$ by 2 and does not change $E$. Again, (i) - (iii) are maintained after the answer of Lucas.\n\nIn conclusion, Lucas is able to answer any move of Agustin at the second stage, hence he will not lose. The game is finite; there will be a loser, and it is not Lucas. Hence eventually Agustin loses and thus Lucas wins.",

          "latex": "We describe a winning strategy for the second player Lucas. It apply to any grid square $n \\times n$ with odd $n \\ge 3$. Call a row or column empty, incomplete or full at a certain moment of the game if it contain respectively 0, 1 or 2 marked cells. The strategy of Lucas has two stages.\n\n\\textbf{Stage 1:} The first move of Agustin has the following properties. It is in an empty row $R$ and an empty column $C$, and after it there are still empty rows left. Call such a move \\emph{standard}. The answer of Lucas to a standard move of Agustin is to choose an empty row $R' \\neq R$ and mark the intersection of $R'$ and column $C$. Such a \\emph{standard} answer is allowed by the rules, and it makes $C$ a full column; thus $C$ cannot be used later on. Let Lucas give standard answers as long as Agustin makes standard moves (at least Agustin's first move is standard). Observe that each column either empty or full after every standard answer of Lucas, hence Agustin's next move is in an empty column. Since there is a standard answer to any standard move, Lucas cannot lose if all of Agustin's moves are standard. Suppose then that Agustin makes non-standard moves, and let $M$ be the first one of them. As explained above, $M$ is in an empty column $C$. There are two possibilities: (1) $M$ is in an incomplete row $R$; (2) $M$ is in the last empty row remaining. In case (1) there are still empty rows left. Indeed each previous combined move of the two leaves an odd number of empty rows because $n$ is odd. So Lucas gives a standard answer again: taking an empty row $R' \\neq R$ and marking the intersection of $R'$ and column $C$. In case (2), all rows are incomplete after $M$. Here Lucas takes any row $R' \\neq R$ and marks the intersection of $R'$ and column $C$, thus making $R'$ full. This completes stage 1. As a result the table has the following properties:\n\n(i) The number $E$ of empty rows is even.\n\n(ii) The number $I$ of incomplete rows is even.\n\n(iii) There are no incomplete columns.\n\nIndeed $E$ is odd and $I$ is even after all moves before $M$, while the last combined move of the two decreases $E$ by 1 and does not change $I$, in both case 1 and 2. Hence (i) and (ii) hold. As for (iii), it holds after every move of Lucas so far.\n\n\\textbf{Stage 2:} Now Lucas makes sure that after each move of his properties (i) – (iii) are preserved. Let us justify that he can achieve this no matter how Agustin plays.\n\nLet Agustin make a move $M$ in row $R$ and column $C$, where $R$ is empty. Then $C$ was also empty before $M$. This is because by (iii) there were no incomplete columns before $M$, and one cannot move in a full column. So $M$ makes both $R$ and $C$ incomplete, in particular, by (i), $E$ is odd after $M$. Hence it is possible for Lucas to mark the intersection of one empty row $R' \\neq R$ and column $C$. This is a standard answer which makes $C$ full and $R'$ incomplete. Thus the combined move of Agustin and Lucas decreases $E$ by 2 and increases $I$ by 2. Hence (i) – (iii) are preserved after the answer of Lucas.\n\nSimilarly let Agustin make a move $M$ in row $R$ and column $C$ where $R$ is incomplete. As in the previous case, $C$ was empty before $M$. So $M$ makes $R$ full and $C$ incomplete. Then by (ii) $I$ is odd after $M$. Hence Lucas can mark the intersection of one incomplete row $R' \\neq R$ and column $C$,\n\nmaking both $R'$ and $C$ full. The combined move of Agustin and Lucas decreases $I$ by 2 and does not change $E$. Again, (i) – (iii) are maintained after the answer of Lucas.\n\nIn conclusion, Lucas is able to answer any move of Agustin at the second stage, hence he will not lose. The game is finite; there will be a loser, and it is not Lucas. Hence eventually Agustin loses and thus Lucas wins.",

Consider the progression arithmetic progression $P$ with first term $p$, common difference $q-p$ and length $n$; its terms are $a_k = p + k(q-p)$, $k=0,1,\\dots,n-1$. Observe that $a_0 = p$ is the only term divisible by $p$. Indeed if $p$ divides $a_k$ with $k \\ge 1$ then $p$ divides $k$ or $q-p$. Both are impossible: Since $p$ is a prime, it divides neither $k$ (as $0 < k < n < p$) nor $q-p$ (as $q$ is a prime greater than $p$). Similarly $a_1 = q$ is the only term divisible by $q$. If $q$ divides $a_k$ with $k \\ge 2$ then $q$ divides $k-1$ or $p$. Neither one is possible as $q$ is prime and $0 < k-1 < n < q$, $p < q$. In addition $q$ does not divide $a_0 = p$ since $p < q$.\n\nNext, let $A = a_0 a_1 \\dots a_{n-1}$ be the product of the terms of $P$. By the above $A$ is exactly divisible by $p$ and $q$. Multiply each $a_k$ by $A$ to obtain a new progression $a_0 A, a_1 A, \\dots, a_{n-1} A$ of length $n$. The product of its terms $a_0 a_1 \\dots a_{n-1} A'' = A'^{n+1}$ is a perfect $(n+1)$-st power. Because $p$ divides $a_k$ only for $k=0$ and $A$ is exactly divisible by $p$, it follows that each of the terms $a_1 A, \\dots, a_{n-1} A$ is also exactly divisible by $p$, hence not a perfect power. Similarly, since $a_0 = p$ is not divisible by $q$ and $A$ is exactly divisible by $q$, the first term $a_0 A$ of the new progression is exactly divisible by $q$. So $a_0 A$ is not a perfect power, which completes the justification that the progression $a_0 A, a_1 A, \\dots, a_{n-1} A$ satisfies the given conditions.",

In conclusion the solution to the problem for $n=2k+i$ are the numbers 1, 2, ..., $k+1$, yielding 1, 2, ..., 500 as the answer to the original question.\n\nSimilarly, for even $n=2k$ we have $\\lfloor \\frac{n+1}{2} \\rfloor = k$, and $d=k$ is admissible.

Form the $\\binom{11}{4} = 330$ (unordered) quadruples $i, j, k, l$ with\n\nelements from $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 11\\}$. To every such quadruple assign a row of length $12$ in which there are $1$'s exactly at positions $i, j, k, l$; the remaining entries are $0$'s. The obtained $330$ rows can be arranged to form a $330 \\times 12$ table, which satisfies conditions (a) – (c) by construction. (For condition (c) note that column $12$ contains only zeros.)\n\nLet us show that $n \\le 330$ for each table $T$ with the given properties. For each row $F$ consider the $4$ columns that intersect it at $1$'s. We say that they form an *admissible* quadruple $Q$. It is uniquely determined by $F$ in view of condition (b). In addition different rows generate different admissible quadruples by condition (a). Hence there is a bijection between the rows and the admissible quadruples; in particular there are exactly $n$ admissible quadruples.\n\nLet $Q$ be an admissible quadruple. Consider all partitions of its complementary $8$ columns into $2$\n\nquadruples $Q_1$ and $Q_2$. Since $4$ columns out of $8$ can be chosen in $\\binom{8}{4}$ ways, there are $\\frac{1}{2} \\binom{8}{4}$ such\n\npartitions. Clearly the quadruples $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are different for different partitions. Observe also that in each partition at least one of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ is non-admissible. Indeed if $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are admissible then no column intersects their respective rows at $3$ zeros, which contradicts $1$-condition\n\n(c). Hence the specified $\\frac{1}{2} \\binom{8}{4}$ partitions generate at least $\\frac{1}{2} \\binom{8}{4}$ no-admissible quadruples\n\nassociated to the initial admissible quadruple $Q$. Because there are $n$ admissible quadruples, this argument yields a list of $l \\ge \\frac{1}{2} \\binom{8}{4}$ $n$-non-admissible quadruples. We are about to see that the\n\nrepetitions in it are not too numerous.\n\nEach non-admissible quadruple $Q'$ on the list occurs in it as many times as there are admissible quadruples $Q$ that generate $Q'$ in the way explained above. Every such $Q$ occupies $4$ columns\n\namong the $8$ complementary columns of $Q'$, which gives at most $\\binom{8}{4}$ possibilities for $Q$.\n\nConsequently every no-admissible quadruple on the list occurs at most $\\binom{8}{4}$ times in it.\n\nGiven the length $l \\ge \\frac{1}{2} \\binom{8}{4}$ of the list and the maximum number $\\binom{8}{4}$ of repetitions of an item, we\n\nfind at least $\\frac{n}{2}$ different no-admissible quadruple in $T$. The total number of quadruples of columns is $\\binom{12}{4} = 495$. Exactly $n$ of them are admissible and $495-n$ are non-admissible.

The allowed operation is choosing a $k$-element subset of $B$ and increasing each of its elements by 1 modulo 1001.\n\nLet us show that a winning number $k$ is coprime with 1001. Assume on the contrary that $\\gcd(k,1001)=d > 1$ and consider any set $B$ chosen by Bibi. Let the elements of $B$ have sum $S$. Suppose Alex chooses $k$ numbers from $B$ of which $m$ are 1000. Then the operation increases $S$ by $(k-m)-1000m = k-1001m$, a number divisible by $d$ in view of $\\gcd(k,1001)=d$. Hence the operation does not change $S$ modulo $d$, for any choice of $B$. Let $B$ contain one number 1 and $|B|-1$ zeros. Then $S=1(\\text{mod } d)$ persists after each operation, while the desired \"all zeros\" final state requires $S \\equiv 0(\\text{mod } d)$. The contradiction proves that $\\gcd(k,1001)=1$ is a necessary condition for $k$ to be winning.\n\nConversely, $\\gcd(k,1001)=1$ is sufficient. For a proof consider the unique integer $l$ in $\\{1,...,1000\\}$ such that $kl \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1001}$. Let $B$ any set chosen by Bibi and $b \\in B$ an arbitrary element. It is enough to show that there is a sequence of operations that adds 1 modulo 1001 to $b$ without affecting the remaining numbers in $B$.\n\nTake a $(k+1)$-element subset $C$ of $B$ that contains $b$. This is possible as $|B| > k$. Apply the operation $l$ times to each $k$-element subset of $C$. Each element of $C$ is contained in exactly $k$ such subsets, so the procedure increases it $kl$ times modulo 1001. Because $kl \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1001}$, the result is that each element of $C$ is increased by 1 modulo 1001. Now take the $k$-element subset $C\\{b\\}$ of $C$ and apply the operation 1000 times. After all described operations each element of $C\\{b\\}$ is\n\nincreased by $1+1000=1001$ modulo 1001 with respect to its initial state, meaning that the operations do not change it. Clearly the elements of $B \\setminus C$ do not change either. The only change concerns $b$ which is increased by 1 modulo 1001, as needed. Hence $\\gcd(k,1001)=1$ is a sufficient conditions, and the solution is complete.",

For clarity we state separately a fact used later in a proof of the lower bound $S(\\alpha) \\ge 2(1+...+k)$ for each permutation $\\alpha$ of $1,2,...,3k+1$.\n\n*Claim.* If $2k$ distinct natural numbers are divided into $k$ pairs $u_j, v_j$ with $u_j < v_j$, $j=1,...,k$, then $v_1 + ... + v_k \\ge 2(1+...+k)$.\n\nThe justification is by induction on $k$, with obvious base case $k=1$.\n\nFor the inductive step $k-1 \\to k$ choose the labeling so that $v_k := \\max_{j=1}^k v_j$. Ignore $u_k$ and $v_k$ for the time being, and apply the inductive hypothesis to the remaining $2k-2$ numbers. This gives $v_1 + ... + v_{k-1} \\ge 2(1+...+(k-1))$. So it is enough to prove $v_k \\ge 2k$ in order to complete the inductive step. We have $v_k > v_j$ for all $j=1,...,k-1$ by $v_k = \\max_{j=1}^k v_j$. In addition observe that $v_k > u_j$ for all $j=1,...,k$. This holds for $j=k$ by hypothesis. Suppose that $v_k < u_j$ for some $j=1,...,k-1$. Then $u_j < v_j$ implies $v_k < v_j$, which contradicts the maximum choice of $v_k$. In summary there are $2k-1$ distinct natural numbers smaller than $v_k$, namely $u_1,...,u_k, v_1,...,v_{k-1}$. Hence $v_k \\ge 2k$, completing the induction.\n\nNow let $\\alpha = (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{3k+1})$ be any permutation of $1,2,...,3k+1$. Divide $a_1, a_2, ..., a_{3k}$ into $k$ triples $T_j = \\{a_{3j-2}, a_{3j-1}, a_{3j}\\}$, $j=1,...,k$. Let $u_j$ and $v_j$ be respectively the smaller number and the middle number in $T_j$. The $2k$ numbers $u_j, v_j$, $j=1,...,k$, are distinct. Then the claim above gives $v_1 + ... + v_k \\ge 2(1+...+k)$. Since $v_1, ..., v_k$ are marked numbers (in general there are more of them), the sum $S(\\alpha)$ of all marked number in $\\alpha$ also satisfies $S(\\alpha) \\ge 2(1+...+k)$.\n\nThe equality $S(\\alpha) = 2(1+...+k)$ is attained for the following permutation of $1,2,...,3k+1$: $3k+1, 1, 2, 2k+1, 4, 3, 2k+2, 6, 5, 2k+3, ..., 2k-2, 2k-3, 3k-1, 2k, 2k-1, 3k$.\n\nThe marked numbers are precisely $2, 4, ..., 2k$, hence $S(\\alpha) = 2(1+...+k)$. This completes the proof of $S_{\\min} = 2(1+...+k) = k(k+1)$.",

In summary the table has at most $17+17=34$ numbers $k$, as stated.\n\nSince each $k \\in \\{1, 2, ..., n\\}$ occurs in the table $x_k \\le 34$ times, the equality $x_i + ... + x_n = 17^2$ yields $n \\ge \\frac{17^2}{34}$, meaning that $n \\ge 9$. For an example with $n=9$ consider the diagonals parallel to the main diagonal containing the bottom left and the top right cell. Label them consecutively 1, 2, ..., 33 so that the top left cell is diagonal 1 and the bottom right cell is diagonal 33. For each $k=1, 2, ..., 9$ write $k$ in all cells of diagonals 2k-1 and 2k; for each $k=1, 2, ..., 7$ write $k$ in all cells of diagonals 2k+17 and 2k+18; finally write 8 in the only cell of diagonal 33. In every row and column there are at most two numbers equal to a given $k \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 9\\}$; and if there are two of them then they are adjacent. It follows that the table satisfies the given conditions.",

Then, by the\n\nabove, the sum of the 8 vertex products $a_i b_j c_k$ equals $(a_1 + a_2)(b_1 + b_2)(c_1 + c_2) = d_1 d_2 d_3 = 315$.\n\nNote that the representations $d_1 = a_1 + a_2, d_2 = b_1 + b_2, d_3 = c_1 + c_2$ can be chosen in different ways. But the sum $a_1 + a_2 + b_1 + b_2 + c_1 + c_2$ which we are interested in is the same, equal to $d_1 + d_2 + d_3$ and depending only on the triple of divisors $d_1, d_2, d_3$ with the properties stated above.\n\nIn this way the question reduces to finding all factorizations $315 = d_1d_2d_3$ with factors $d_i > 1$. All solutions to the problem are the respective sums $D = d_1 + d_2 + d_3$. Since $315 = 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$, consider two cases. If one of the $d_i$'s be divisible by $3^2 = 9$ then it is immediate that the factorization is $5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 9$ and $D = 5 + 7 + 9 = 21$. Otherwise two $d_i$'s are exactly divisible by 3, and it is clear that one of them is in fact equal to 3. It remains to factorize $3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$ into two factors greater than 1, which can be done in 3 ways: $15 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 35 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 21$. Hence the remaining possibilities for admissible factorizations of 315 are $3 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 35 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 21$. They yield respectively $D = 25, 41, 29$. In summary the answer to the problem is 21, 25, 29, and 41.",

By \\textit{segments} we mean the sides and the diagonals of the $n$-gon; the sides are the shortest among all segments.\n\nLet $n$ be good and $T$ an isosceles triangulation of the regular $n$-gon $P$. Suppose that the base of a triangle $\\Delta \\in T$ is a side $a$ of $P$. Then the vertex of $\\Delta$ opposing $a$ is on the perpendicular bisector of $a$, which passes through the center of $P$, and also the circumcircle of $P$. Hence $n$ is odd and the center of $P$ is interior to $\\Delta$, implying that such a triangle $\\Delta$ is unique.\n\nLet $n$ be even. Then sides are the shortest segments and none of them is a base of a triangle of $T$. So all of them are divided into pairs of consecutive ones, and each pair contains the equal sides of a triangle of T. Deleting these $\\frac{n}{2}$ isosceles triangles leaves a regular $\\frac{n}{2}$-gon which therefore also admits of an isosceles triangulation. It follows that an even $n \\ge 6$ is good if and only if so is $\\frac{n}{2}$.\n\nLet $n$ be odd. Then the sides cannot be paired up like in the even case, one of them must be a base of a triangle $\\Delta$ from $T$ as explained earlier. The equal sides of $\\Delta$ are diagonals of $P$ (longest ones). Removing $\\Delta$ leaves two congruent polygons which must have isosceles triangulations. Let $P_1$ be one of them. It has $n_1 = \\frac{1}{2}(n(n+1))$ sides; thus $n_1$ is good. One of the sides is a diagonal $d_1$, the rest are sides of $P$, hence shorter. So $d_1$ is a base of a triangle $\\Delta_1$ of $T$, and its opposite vertex divides the remaining $n_1 - 3$ vertices into two equal halves. It follows that $n_1$ is odd. Remove $\\Delta_1$ from $P_1$ and denote by $P_2$ one of the two obtained congruent polygons with $n_2 = \\frac{1}{2}(n_4 + 1)$ sides; $n_2$ is good. The same argument applies to $P_2$ because one of its sides is a diagonal $d_2$, and the rest are sides of $P$. We\n\nconclude that $n_2$ is odd then define $n_3 = \\frac{1}{2}(n_2 + 1)$, and so on. Thus each of the numbers\n\n$n > n_1 > n_2 > \\dots$ is odd and good, as long as it is $\\ge 3$. Let $k$ be such that $n_k \\ge 3 > n_{k+1}$. If $n_{k+1} = 1$ then\n\n$n_k = 1$ which is false. So $n_{k+1} = 2$ and so $n_k = 3$. Write $n_k = 3 = 2^1 + 1$ and backwards to obtain $n_{k-1} = 2^2 + 1$ and likewise $n_{k-2} = 2^3 + 1$, ..., $n_1 = 2^k + 1$, $n = 2^{k+1} + 1$. Therefore $n-1$ is a power of 2. In addition the steps of the argument imply a construction showing that the converse is also true.\n\nTo sum up, consider two cases for a general $n$. If $n \\ge 4$ is a power of 2, $n = 2^m$ with $m \\ge 2$, then it is good if and only if so are $2^{m-1}, 2^{m-2}, \\dots, 2^2 = 4$. Since the square has an isosceles triangulation, the powers of 2 are good. If $n \\ge 3$ is not a power of 2 then $n = 2^m$ with $k \\ge 3$ odd and $m \\ge 0$. By the above, $n$ is good if and only if so is $k$, and the latter holds if and only if $k$ is of the form $k = 2^l + 1$ with $l \\ge 1$. Hence $n = 2^n + 2^l$ with $u > v \\ge 0$. In conclusion the good numbers are $2^m$ with $m \\ge 2$ and $2^n + 2^l$ with $u > v \\ge 0$.",

By hypothesis $a = \\frac{44}{100}(b+c) = \\frac{11}{25}(N-a)$, hence $a = \\frac{11}{36}N$; also $c < a$.\n\nThe number of voters in the second round is $N' = N - \\frac{p}{100}c$. There are $\\left(1 - \\frac{p}{100}\\right)c$ persons who voted for $C$ in the first round and participate in the second round. For brevity call them and their votes additional. Since $B$'s supporters voted for him in both rounds, the most $A$ can achieve is that his own supporters vote for him again in the second round, and also the additional voters. So the\n\nmaximum number of votes A can get is $a_{max} = a + \\left(1 - \\frac{p}{100}\\right)c$. We are interested in the difference\n\n$N^{-1} - 2a_{max}$ (whose sign determines the chances of A):\n\n$$\nN^{-1} - 2a_{max} = \\left(N - \\frac{p}{100}c\\right) - 2 \\cdot \\frac{11}{36}N - 2\\left(1 - \\frac{p}{100}\\right)c = \\frac{7}{18}N - \\frac{200-p}{100}c.\n$$\n\nLet us say already here that the different outcomes for $p \\ge 73$ and $p \\le 72$ are due to the inequalities\n\n$$\n\\frac{127}{100} + \\frac{11}{36} < \\frac{7}{18} + \\frac{128}{100} < \\frac{11}{36}\n$$\n\n(which hold as $127 \\cdot 11 = 1397 < 1400 = 100 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 7 < 128 \\cdot 11 = 1408$).\n\nSuppose that $p \\ge 73$. Then $\\frac{200-p}{100}c < \\frac{127}{100}c < \\frac{127}{100}a = \\frac{127}{100}N$. Since $\\frac{127}{100} < \\frac{11}{36} < \\frac{7}{18}$, it follows\n\nthat $\\frac{200-p}{100}c < \\frac{7}{18}N$, i. e. $N^{-1} - 2a_{max} > 0$. So A cannot win even if he gets the maximum possible number of votes. Therefore B wins with certainty, and the journalist is right.\n\nFor $p \\le 72$ there are examples showing that either candidate can win. In this case $\\frac{200-p}{100}c \\ge \\frac{128}{100}c$.\n\nNow the inequality $\\frac{7}{18} < \\frac{128}{100} \\cdot \\frac{11}{36}$ (see above) implies $\\frac{100}{128} \\cdot \\frac{7}{18} < \\frac{11}{36}N$. Take N such that both sides of the inequality are integers differing by more than 1, for instance $N = 2lcm(36,128)$. Then an integer c can be chosen so that $\\frac{100}{128} < \\frac{7}{18}N < \\frac{11}{36}N$. The condition $c < a$ for the first round is satisfied. For this choice of c we have $\\frac{7}{18}N < \\frac{128}{100}c$, and $\\frac{200-p}{100}c \\ge \\frac{128}{100}c$ was shown above for $p \\le 72$, which implies $N^{-1} - 2a_{max} < 0$. So A wins if he gets $a_{max}$ votes. This is possible if all of his\n\nsupporters vote for him again, and also all additional voters. On the other hand it is clear that B is a possible winner for any p, for instance if A gets no votes at all (which is not excluded by the conditions). It is of more substance to note that B can also win for $p \\le 72$ even if all of A's supporters vote for him again in the second round. Indeed if $p \\le 72$ then\n\n$c < a$ implies $N' = N - \\frac{p}{100}c > N - \\frac{72}{100}a = N - \\frac{72}{100} \\cdot \\frac{11}{36}N = \\frac{39}{50}N$.\n\nThis is greater than $2a = \\frac{11}{18}N$,\n\nso if all additional votes go to B the B wins.\n\nRemark. There are values of N for which the situation can describe actual elections, for instance, $N = 1800000$. Then $a = \\frac{11}{36}N = 550000$ and, for $p \\le 72$, the key number for the construction is\n\n$\\frac{100}{128} \\cdot \\frac{7}{18}N = 546875 < 550000$. So there are plenty of (integer) choices for c in [546875, 550000].",

Mark 51 blue points on it so that they determine 51 consecutive arcs of lengths $a_1, \\dots, a_{51}$. One may imagine each number $a_i$ written next to an arc of $\\gamma$ with length $a_i$. So, starting from a certain blue point $B$, the numbers are arranged around $\\gamma$ as in the given row.\n\nThe claim that $k$ or $100-k$ is representable is equivalent to saying that there is an arc $\\alpha$ of length $k$ with blue endpoints. Indeed consider $\\alpha$ and its complementary arc $\\alpha'$, of length $100-k$. Point $B$ cannot be interior to both $\\alpha$ and $\\alpha'$, hence $k$ or $100-k$ equals the sum of several consecutive numbers in the initial row.\n\nWe show that for each $k \\le 50$ there is an arc of length $k$ with blue endpoints (once this is proven, the case $k > 50$ follows trivially). Mark 49 more red points on $\\gamma$ so that the total of marked 100 points, blue and red, yields a division into arcs of length 1. Now $k=50$ is almost immediate. To each blue point assign its diametrically opposite point (the number 100 of division points is even). The 51 assigned points are distinct. Since there are $49 < 51$ red points, some assigned point is blue, which is enough.\n\nThe essential case $k < 50$ needs an appropriate modification. For each blue point $X$ write down the endpoints of the arc with length $2k$ and midpoint $X$ (this arc is \"proper\", it does not overlap itself). One obtains a list of $2 \\cdot 51 = 102$ points. It is clear that no point occurs in it more than twice.\n\nTherefore the list contains at least 51 distinct points. There are only 49 < 51 red points.

Note that $\\alpha$ has exactly two subsequence sums in the interval $[1810-48, 1810+48] = [1762, 1858]$. They are its extremes: 1858 the sum of the entire sequence and 1762, the sum of all terms except one 96. This example shows that the minimum *d* in question is at least 48.\n\nWe show that each admissible sequence has a subsequence sum in the interval [1762,1858], implying that the answer is $d_{\\min} = 48$. Suppose on the contrary that this is false for an admissible sequence $\\beta$. Still more is it false for any subsequence of $\\beta$. So by possibly removing terms one may assume that $\\beta$ is minimal, with sum $S > 1810$ but with sum $\\le 1810$ of each proper subsequence. In fact the assumption then implies $S \\ge 1859$ and $T \\le 1761$ for every proper subsequence sum $T$. In particular, if $t$ is any term of $\\beta$ then $S-t \\le 1761$.

Assume there is a board where the value is at most 3. Then, all the numbers from 5 to 16 are not neighbors of 1 and so, 1 can only have 2, 3 and 4 in adjacent cells. It follows that 1 cannot be in the interior cells of the board (since these cells have 4 adjacent cells each). Therefore, 1 is written in a cell on the border of the board. Let us consider two cases:\n\n\\textbf{Case 1:} 1 is written in a cell on the border but not in a corner.\n\nIn this case, we may assume that 1 is written in the cell in row 1, column 2 (since the remaining 7 cases are equivalent by rotations and reflections). As this cell has exactly 3 adjacent cells (shaded in Figure (a)), the numbers 2, 3 and 4 must be written in them. If 2 is written as in Figures (b) or (c), we have a contradiction, since 1 and 2 combined can only have 3, 4 and 5 as neighbors, but there are more than 3 adjacent cells.

The multiples of 4 satisfying this condition, with no repeated digits and without 0, are\n\n$$\n524.528.548.564.568.584. \\qquad (1)\n$$\n\nIn particular, we deduce that the digit in row 3, column 3 can only be 4 or 8.\n\n<table><tr><td></td><td></td><td>even</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>even</td><td>4 - 8</td></tr></table>\n\nFor the number in the third column, we look for the multiples of 7 beginning with an even digit, ending with 4 or 8, with no repeated digits, and without 0 and 5 among its digits. There are two: 238 and 294. Combining them with the numbers listed in (1), that are the candidates for the third row (note that 524 and 528 cannot be used, since 2 must be written in the first row), we obtain the following possibilities:\n\n<table><tr><td></td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>8</td></tr></table>\n\nBoard 1\n\n<table><tr><td></td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>8</td></tr></table>\n\nBoard 2\n\n<table><tr><td></td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>4</td></tr></table>\n\nBoard 3\n\n<table><tr><td></td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>8</td><td>4</td></tr></table>\n\nBoard 4\n\nTo determine the values of the remaining digits, we take into account that the sums of the digits in row 2 and the sum of the digits in column 2 must be multiples of 3 (in order that the corresponding numbers are multiple of 3 and 6, respectively).\n\n**Board 1:** The remaining digits are 1, 6, 7, 9; thus, two are congruent with 1 modulo 3 and two are congruent with 0 modulo 3.

      "statement_latex": "We will first show that in a valid coloring of the board there cannot be a $3 \\times 3$ sub-board with all its cells painted in blue.\n\nConsider an $n \\times n$ sub-board $T$ with all cells painted in blue, for the maximum $n$, and assume $n \\ge 3$. Since the board has unpainted cells, we may find an $(n+1) \\times (n+1)$ sub-board $Q$ containing $T$. Without loss of generality, we may assume $T$ is in the upper-left corner of $Q$, as in the following picture:\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Argentina_2019_Booklet_p9_data_a09e2d88fe.png)\n\nWe look at the $n$ cells to the left of $T$; we call them $c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n$, from top to bottom. Note that, given two adjacent cells $c_i$ and $c_{i+1}$, there cannot be one painted and the other unpainted, since in this case, the $2 \\times 2$ sub-board of $Q$ containing them would have exactly three painted cells (two cells in $T$ and one in the last column). We deduce that the cells $c_1, \\dots, c_n$ are either all painted or all unpainted. If $n \\ge 3$, the former is not possible, since at least one of the cells $c_1, c_2, c_3$ must be painted so that the $3 \\times 3$ sub-board in the right-upper corner of $Q$ has an odd number of blue cells. We conclude that all the cells $c_i$ must be painted. Similarly, the same holds for all the cells of $Q$ that are below $T$. Now, by looking at the $2 \\times 2$ sub-board in the bottom right corner of $Q$, we deduce that the corner cell is also painted since, otherwise, this sub-board would contain exactly 3 blue cells. Summarizing, we have proved that all the cells of $Q$ are painted in blue, contradicting the maximality of $T$. The contradiction arises from the assumption $n \\ge 3$. It follows that the board cannot contain any $3 \\times 3$ board completely painted in blue. Now consider any $3 \\times 3$ sub-board $T$. By assumption, it contains an odd number of blue cells, and we have proved that this number cannot be 9. Let us show that there cannot be 7 blue cells either. If this is not the case, the two unpainted cells $A$ and $B$ belong to the same $2 \\times 2$ sub-board of $T$ (otherwise, a $2 \\times 2$ sub-board of $T$ containing $A$ would have 3 blue cells). Assume, with no loss of generality, that $A$ and $B$ are in the $2 \\times 2$ sub-board in the upper-left corner of $T$. Then, the 5 cells of $T$ around this sub-board are painted:\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Argentina_2019_Booklet_p9_data_4884f69fd0.png)\n\nBut then, the cell marked with $\\star$ has to be painted so that the $2 \\times 2$ board in the bottom-right corner has an even number of blue cells. From this fact, with a similar argument, it follows that the cells marked with $\\Delta$ are also painted. This contradicts the fact that $T$ has 2 unpainted cells.\n\nWe conclude that every $3 \\times 3$ sub-board has at most 5 blue cells. As the $27 \\times 27$ board can be subdivided into 81 of those sub-boards, we have that Carla can paint at most $5 \\times 81 = 405$ cells in blue. In the next example, in which the pattern is repeated every 3 rows and every 3 columns, every $3 \\times 3$ board has exactly 5 blue cells."

Then, Q, P, M are collinear. Then, the equality $BQM = MQC$ implies that QP is the internal bisector of $BQC$ and, since $PQR = 90^\\circ$, it follows that QS is the external bisector of $BQC$.\n\nSetting $BC = a$, $CA = b$, $AB = c$, and $2p = a+b+c$, we have that $BP = P'C = p-b$, $PC = p-c$ and $PP' = b-c$ (in case $b > c$; the other case is similar), and, by the angle bisector theorem, we have:\n\n$$\n\\frac{BS}{CS} = \\frac{BQ}{CQ} = \\frac{BP}{CP} = \\frac{p-b}{p-c}\n$$\n\nThen,\n\n$$\n\\frac{BS}{BC} = \\frac{BS}{CS - BS} = \\frac{p-b}{p-c - (p-b)} = \\frac{p-b}{b-c}\n$$\n\nor, equivalently, $BS = \\frac{a(p-b)}{b-c}$.\n\nLet S be the area, r the inradius, and $r_A$ the A-exradius of the triangle ABC.\n\nWe have that $RPS = PQS = P'J = 90^\\circ$; hence, $PQS = RPS = P'JP$. Therefore, $PSR \\sim P'JP$, which implies that:\n\n$$\n\\frac{SP}{RP} = \\frac{P'J}{PP'} \\quad \\text{or, equivalently,} \\quad \\frac{\\frac{a(p-b)}{b-c} + (p-b)}{2r} = \\frac{P'J}{b-c}\n$$\n\nand, as a consequence,\n\n$$\nP'J = \\frac{(a+b-c)(p-b)}{2r} = \\frac{(p-c)(p-b)}{S/p} = \\frac{p(p-b)(p-c)}{S} = \\frac{S}{p-a} = r_A\n$$\n\n(here, we use that $S = \\sqrt{p(p-a)(p-b)(p-c)}$.\n\nTherefore, J is the center of the excircle of ABC relative to the vertex A.\n\nSimilarly, it can be proved that $P'Q'$ passes through the incenter I of ABC. (To do this, it suffices to show that $Q'P'$ is the internal bisector of $BQ'C$ and that, if $R'$ is the point diametrically opposite to P' in $\\omega'$, then $R'Q'$ is the external bisector of $BQ'C$. Then, if $S'$ is the intersection point of $R'Q'$ and BC we can show as before that $P'IP \\sim P'S'R'$).\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Argentina_2019_Booklet_p13_data_5d3f45b3c1.png)\n\nNow we will prove that both lines JP and $IP'$ pass through the midpoint T of the altitude AH of the triangle ABC. This finishes the problem, since $T = N$ would be the intersection of the lines JP = PQ and $IP' = P'Q'$, and AT is perpendicular to BC. The homothety with center A that transforms $\\omega$ into $\\omega'$, transforms the diameter RP into the diameter $P'R'$. Since $AHP \\sim R'P'P$ (since $AH \\parallel P'R'$), and PT, PJ are medians relative to the corresponding parallel sides AH and $P'R'$, then T, P and J are collinear. In addition, since $AHP' \\sim RPP'$ (because $AH \\parallel RP$) and $P'I, P'T$ are medians relative to the corresponding parallel sides AH and RP, then T, P', I are also collinear. Therefore, JP and $IP'$ both pass through T, as we wanted to prove.",

By taking $x = a^{11004}$, $y = b^{11004}$ and $z = c^{11004}$, and recalling that $S$ divides $S_{11004}$, we deduce that $S$ divides $S_{33012} - 3(abc)^{11004}$. Since $33012 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$, we know that $S$ divides $S_{33012}$; therefore, $S$ divides $3(abc)^{11004}$.\n\nAssume $p > 3$ is a prime factor of $S$. Since $p$ divides $3(abc)^{11004}$, then, it divides $a, b$ or $c$. With no loss of generality, assume $p$ divides $a$; then, $p$ divides $b+c$, as it divides $S = a+b+c$. But we also have that $p$ divides $a^{12} + b^{12} + c^{12}$, and looking modulo $p$, we get that $a^{12} + b^{12} + c^{12} \\equiv 0^{12} + b^{12} + (-b)^{12} \\equiv 2b^{12} \\pmod{p}$. It follows that $p$ divides $b$ and, as a consequence, it divides $c$, contradicting the fact that $a, b$ and $c$ are coprime. We conclude that $S$ does not have a prime divisor greater than 3.\n\nHence, $S = 2^x3^y$ for non-negative integers $x$ and $y$. Finally, we will show that $x, y \\le 1$. If $x \\ge 2$, we have that $a^{12}+b^{12}+c^{12} \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$. As the quadratic residues modulo 4 are 0 and 1, the only possibility is that $a \\equiv b \\equiv c \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$, contradicting the coprimality of $a, b, c$. Similarly, if $y \\ge 2$, we have that $a^{12} + b^{12} + c^{12} \\equiv 0 \\pmod 9$ but, taking into account that for an integer $m$, the possible residues of $m^6$ modulo 9 are 0 and 1, this implies that $a \\equiv b \\equiv c \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$, which is again a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $S = a+b+c$ are 3 and 6, since $a, b, c$ are positive integers and, consequently, the possible triples $\\{a, b, c\\}$ are $\\{1, 1, 1\\}$, $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$, $\\{1, 1, 4\\}$ and $\\{2, 2, 2\\}$. It is clear that the first one satisfies the conditions and that the last one is not a solution because $a, b, c$ are not coprime. Now, $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$ is not a solution either, since $1+2+3=6$ does not divide $1^{12} + 2^{12} + 3^{12}$ (this number has residue 2 modulo 3). To check that $\\{1, 1, 4\\}$ satisfies the conditions, it suffices to note that $1^r + 1^r + 4^r \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$ and $1^r + 1^r + 4^r \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$ for every positive integer $r$.\n\nWe conclude that the solutions are $\\{1, 1, 1\\}$ and $\\{1, 1, 4\\}$.",

We have that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} S_{11k+1} \\cdot S_{11} &= (a^{11k+1} + b^{11k+1} + c^{11k+1})(a^{11} + b^{11} + c^{11}) \\\\ &= a^{11(k+1)+1} + b^{11(k+1)+1} + c^{11(k+1)+1} + (ab)^{11}(a^{11(k-1)+1} + b^{11(k-1)+1}) \\\\ &\\quad + (ac)^{11}(a^{11(k-1)+1} + c^{11(k-1)+1}) + (bc)^{11}(b^{11(k-1)+1} + c^{11(k-1)+1}) \\\\ &= S_{11(k+1)+1} + ((ab)^{11} + (ac)^{11} + (bc)^{11}) S_{11(k-1)+1} - \\\\ &\\quad (abc)^{11}(a^{11(k-2)+1} + b^{11(k-2)+1} + c^{11(k-2)+1}) \\\\ &= S_{11(k+1)+1} + ((ab)^{11} + (ac)^{11} + (bc)^{11}) S_{11(k-1)+1} - (abc)^{11} S_{11(k-2)+1}. \\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBy the induction assumption, $S$ divides $S_{11k+1}$, $S_{11(k-1)+1}$ and $S_{11(k-2)+1}$; therefore, the above equality implies that $S$ divides $S_{11(k+1)+1}$, as we wanted to prove."

For every positive integer $n$, let $\\alpha(n)$ be the exponent of $p$ in the factorization of $a_n$. We will prove that $\\alpha(n) = 0$ for every $n$.\n\nBy the second condition on the sequence, we know that $\\alpha(n)$ is a multiple of $n$; that is, there exists a non-negative integer $k_n$ such that $\\alpha(n) = n \\cdot k_n$. From the first condition, we have that $a_n! = a_n \\cdot a_{(n-1)!}$. This implies that $\\alpha(n) = \\alpha(n!) - \\alpha((n-1)!)$, that is, $n \\cdot k_n = n! \\cdot k_{n!} - (n-1)! \\cdot k_{(n-1)!}$. Defining $\\beta(n) = (n-1)!$, we have\n\n$$\nk_n = \\frac{\\beta(n)}{n} (n \\cdot k_{n!} - k_{\\beta(n)}). \\qquad (1)\n$$\n\nFor $n \\ge 4$, we will show, recursively, that $\\beta^j(n)$ divides $\\alpha(n)$ for every positive integer $j$, where $\\beta^j(n)$ is the function $\\beta$ applied $j$ times. To this end, we will apply formula (1) recursively. We first establish some facts we will use.\n\nLet $\\gamma_m = \\frac{\\beta(m!)}{m!}$ be the factor appearing in formula (1) when applied to $n = m!$. Note that, for $m \\ge 3$, $\\gamma_m$ is an integer (since $m! - 1 > m$) and divides $k_{m!}$. In addition, $\\gamma_m$ divides $\\gamma_{m+1}$, since $\\frac{((m+1)!)!-1)!}{(m+1)!} = \\frac{1}{m+1} \\cdot ((m+1)! - 1) ((m+1)! - 2) \\cdots m! \\cdot \\frac{(m!-1)!}{m!}$, and $(m+1)! - (m+1) = (m+1)(m! - 1) > m!$; then, $\\gamma_m$ divides $\\gamma_n$ for every $n > m \\ge 3$. Now, we will prove recursively that, for every positive integer $j$, we have that\n\n$$\nk_n = \\frac{\\beta^j(n)}{n} \\cdot N_j.\n$$\n\nwhere $N_j$ is an integer that can be expressed as a sum of $2^j$ multiples of integers of the form $k_{m!}$, where the smallest subindex $m!$ that appears is $\\beta^j(n)$.\n\nFor $j=1$, the statement is clear from identity (1), since $\\beta(n) = (n-1)!$.\n\nAssume the result holds for $j \\ge 1$.
