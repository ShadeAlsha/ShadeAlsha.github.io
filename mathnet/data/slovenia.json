Now, she can write down the square root of 196, which is 14, and finally she can get 55 as $3 \\cdot 14 + 13 = 55$. (Note: there might be other ways of obtaining 55, but this is the only one that requires less than 100 steps).\n\nLet us now show that Maja cannot get 256 from 55. Consider the remainders modulo 4. An even number is of the form $2k$ and its square is $4k^2$. An odd number can be written as $2k + 1$, so its square is equal to $4k^2 + 4k + 1$, giving the remainder of 1 when divided by 4. We see that a perfect square can only give the remainders 0 or 1 when divided by 4, so we can never use the rule $n \\mapsto \\sqrt{n}$ on numbers that give the remainder 2 or 3."

This implies that 47 divides either $p^3$ or $p$. But $p$ is a prime, so this is only possible when $p$ is equal to 47. Indeed, when $p = q = 47$ we have $2p^2q + 45pq^2 = 47^4$, which is a perfect square.\n\nNow, let $p \\neq q$. Since $2p^2q + 45pq^2 = pq(2p + 45q)$ is a perfect square divisible by $p$, it must also be divisible by $p^2$. So, $p$ divides $q(2p + 45q)$ or, since $p$ and $q$ are coprime, $p$ divides $2p + 45q$. We conclude that $p$ divides $45q$, so $p$ divides 45. There are two possible cases: $p = 3$ or $p = 5$.

Let KLM be a triangle with the obtuse angle $\\angle KLM$ and let H be the orthocentre. The point H lies outside the triangle KLM and on a different side of the line KL than M. Let L' and K' be the feet of the altitudes from L and K. Since $\\angle ML'H = \\angle MK'H$, points M, L', K', H are concyclic and $\\angle KML = \\angle LHK$.\n\nThe following fact is also worth mentioning: since $K'KM$ is a right triangle the angle $K'KM$ is acute. Points $K', K, L', L$ are concyclic, so $\\angle HLM = \\pi - \\angle K'KL$, and the angle $\\angle HLM$ is obtuse.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Slovenija_2008_p32_data_3561dade66.png)\n\nLet us now return to the original problem. Here to help us are the facts stated above and a new and less cluttered figure.\n\nSince $|AC| = |BD|$, the inscribed angles over this two chords are equal, so $\\angle ADC = \\angle BAD$, which implies $\\angle CBA = \\pi - \\angle ADC = \\pi - \\angle BAD = \\angle DCB$, so AD and BC are parallel and ABCD is an isosceles trapezoid.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Slovenija_2008_p32_data_52866eb789.png)\n\nPoints A, B, C and D are concyclic, so $\\angle CAD = \\angle CBD$. From the above consideration we see that $\\angle DH_1C = \\angle CAD$ and $\\angle DH_2C = \\angle CBD$,\n\nso $\\angle DH_1C = \\angle DH_2C$ and points $C, H_1, H_2, D$ are concyclic. But $H_1C$ is perpendicular to $AD$, $H_2D$ is perpendicular to $BC$ and lines $BC$ and $AD$ are parallel, so $H_1C$ and $H_2D$ are parallel as well. The cyclic quadrilateral $CH_1H_2D$ has a pair of parallel sides $H_1C$ and $H_2D$ and is therefore an isosceles trapezoid.\n\nWe have seen that $CH_1H_2D$ and $ABCD$ are isosceles trapezoids, so we have $|H_1H_2| = |CD| = |AB|$. The altitude $AH_1$ is perpendicular to the side $CD$ and so is the altitude $BH_2$, hence $AH_1$ and $BH_2$ are parallel. The quadrilateral $ABH_2H_1$ has a pair of parallel sides ($BH_2$ and $AH_1$) and a pair of sides of equal length ($AB$ and $H_1H_2$). Thus, it is either an isosceles trapezoid or a parallelogram. Let us demonstrate that it is, in fact, the latter.\n\nLines $AH_1$ and $BH_2$ are parallel, so the point $H_1$ lies on the side of the line $BH_2$ not containing $C$. As we have shown above the angle $\\angle DCH_1$ is obtuse, so the angle $\\angle CH_1H_2$, which is equal to $\\angle DCH_1$, is also obtuse. But $\\angle AH_1H_2 = \\angle AH_1C + \\angle CH_1H_2 > \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, so the angle $\\angle AH_1H_2$ is obtuse. On the other hand, the angle $\\angle CAH_1$ is acute, so $\\angle BAH_1 = \\angle CAH_1 - \\angle CAB$ is acute as well (points $B$ and $H_1$ lie on the same side of the line $AC$, because neither of them lies on the same side as $D$). We have shown that $\\angle BAH_1$ is acute and $\\angle AH_1H_2$ is obtuse, so the quadrilateral $ABH_2H_1$ is a parallelogram. Hence, $H_1H_2$ is parallel to $AB$.\n\nSimilarly, we show that $H_2H_3$ is parallel to $ED$. If we wish to prove that $\\angle H_1H_2H_3 = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, it suffices to see that lines $AB$ and $ED$ intersect at a right angle.\n\nDenote the intersection of $AB$ and $ED$ by $T$. Since $\\angle BET = \\angle BED = \\frac{1}{2}\\angle BOD = 30^\\circ$ and $\\angle TBE = \\pi - \\angle EBA = \\pi - \\angle ECA = \\pi - 120^\\circ = 60^\\circ$, we have $\\angle ETB = \\pi - \\angle TBE - \\angle BET = 90^\\circ$. So $\\angle ATE = 90^\\circ$ and this concludes our proof.",

But $H_1C$ is perpendicular to $AD$, $H_2D$ is perpendicular to $BC$ and lines $BC$ and $AD$ are parallel, so $H_1C$ and $H_2D$ are parallel as well. The cyclic quadrilateral $CH_1H_2D$ has a pair of parallel sides $H_1C$ and $H_2D$ and is therefore an isosceles trapezoid.\n\nWe have seen that $CH_1H_2D$ and $ABCD$ are isosceles trapezoids, so we have $|H_1H_2| = |CD| = |AB|$. The altitude $AH_1$ is perpendicular to the side $CD$ and so is the altitude $BH_2$, hence $AH_1$ and $BH_2$ are parallel. The quadrilateral $ABH_2H_1$ has a pair of parallel sides ($BH_2$ and $AH_1$) and a pair of sides of equal length ($AB$ and $H_1H_2$). Thus, it is either an isosceles trapezoid or a parallelogram. Let us demonstrate that it is, in fact, the latter.\n\nLines $AH_1$ and $BH_2$ are parallel, so the point $H_1$ lies on the side of the line $BH_2$ not containing $C$. As we have shown above the angle $\\angle DCH_1$ is obtuse, so the angle $\\angle CH_1H_2$, which is equal to $\\angle DCH_1$, is also obtuse. But $\\angle AH_1H_2 = \\angle AH_1C + \\angle CH_1H_2 > \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, so the angle $\\angle AH_1H_2$ is obtuse. On the other hand, the angle $\\angle CAH_1$ is acute, so $\\angle BAH_1 = \\angle CAH_1 - \\angle CAB$ is acute as well (points $B$ and $H_1$ lie on the same side of the line $AC$, because neither of them lies on the same side as $D$). We have shown that $\\angle BAH_1$ is acute and $\\angle AH_1H_2$ is obtuse, so the quadrilateral $ABH_2H_1$ is a parallelogram. Hence, $H_1H_2$ is parallel to $AB$.\n\nSimilarly, we show that $H_2H_3$ is parallel to $ED$. If we wish to prove that $\\angle H_1H_2H_3 = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, it suffices to see that lines $AB$ and $ED$ intersect at a right angle.\n\nDenote the intersection of $AB$ and $ED$ by $T$. Since $\\angle BET = \\angle BED = \\frac{1}{2}\\angle BOD = 30^\\circ$ and $\\angle TBE = \\pi - \\angle EBA = \\pi - \\angle ECA = \\pi - 120^\\circ = 60^\\circ$, we have $\\angle ETB = \\pi - \\angle TBE - \\angle BET = 90^\\circ$. So $\\angle ATE = 90^\\circ$ and this concludes our proof.\n\n**Second solution.** Since $\\angle CH_3B = \\angle BEC = \\angle BDC = \\angle CH_2B$, points $C, H_3, H_2, B$ are concyclic.

If we want $I = a + b^2 + \\frac{3b}{a} - \\frac{1}{b}$ to be an integer, then $N = \\frac{3b}{a} - \\frac{1}{b}$ has to be an integer as well. Since $N = \\frac{3b^2-a}{ab}$, we conclude that $ab$ must divide $3b^2-a$. This implies that $b$ divides $3b^2-a$, so $b$ divides $a$.\n\nWe can now write $a = kb$. Then $N = \\frac{3b-k}{kb}$, so $kb$ divides $3b-k$. $b$ divides $3b-k$. or. finally, $b$ divides $k$. Let $k = lb$. Then $N = \\frac{3-l}{lb}$. We see that $l$ must divide $3-l$. so $l$ divides 3. We have $a = lb^2$ where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers. so $l$ is also a positive integer and we have either $l = 1$ or $l = 3$.\n\nIf $l = 1$ then $N = \\frac{2}{b}$ and $b = 1$ or $b = 2$. In the first case we get $a = 1$. in the second case $a = 4$. If $l = 3$ then $N = 0$ and $a = 3b^2$.\n\nFinally, we need to determine the value of $I$. If $a = b = 1$ then $I = 4$, if $a = 4$ and $b = 2$ then $I = 9$ and if $a = 3b^2$ then $I = 4b^2 = (2b)^2$, so $I$ is indeed a perfect square.\n\nIf $a = 4$ and $b = -2$ then $l = 7$. If $a = -4$ and $b = -2$ then $l = 2$. In both cases $l$ is a positive integer, but it is not a perfect square.\n\n\\textbf{Remark.} As in the first part of the problem we can show that $a = 4$, $b = -2$ and $a = -4$. $b = -2$ are the only two cases where $l$ is a positive integer but not a perfect square. We know from the first part that at least one of the numbers $a$ and $b$ is negative. As above, we conclude that $a = lb^2$ and $l = b^2 + a + \\frac{3-l}{lb} = (l-1)b^2 + \\frac{3-l}{lb}$. In this case we can choose $l$ or $b$ to be negative.\n\nWe know that $l$ divides 3. So it can be equal to 1, -1, 3 or -3. If $l = 3$ then $a = 3b^2$ and $l = (2b)^2$ regardless of what $b$ is. When $l = 1$ we have $b = -1$ or $b = -2$. In the first case $l = 0$ and in the second case $a = 4$ and $l = 7$.\n\nIf $l = -1$ then $l = -\\frac{1}{2}$. So, $l$ is a positive divisor of 4, but not a perfect square. Hence, $l = 2$. $b = -2$. $a = -4$. In the remaining case we have $l = -3$ and $l = -2b^2 - \\frac{1}{2}$. This is an integer when $b = \\pm 1$ or $b = \\pm 2$, but $l$ is negative in both cases.\n\nHence, $l$ is a positive integer but not a perfect square if and only if $a = 4$, $b = -2$ or $a = -4$. $b = -2$.",

Since $T_2, O, O_2$ are collinear and $T_4, O, O_4$ are collinear, we get $\\angle O_4OO_2 = \\angle T_4OT_2 = \\gamma = \\angle O_4DO_2$ and $O$ lies on the circuncircle of the triangle $O_2DO_4$.

The same arguments would show that $t_B$ is the line through $J$ parallel to $A_1C_1$ and $t_C$ is the line through $J$ parallel to $A_1B_1$. Hence, all three tangents intersect at a single point, namely $J$.",

On the other hand, $AA_2$ is the bisector of the angle $\\angle BAC$, so $A_2$ is the incentre of the triangle $AC_1B_1$.\n\nAs we draw the line $A_1A_2$ onto the figure we notice that the common intersection of the tangents lies on this line. Let $B_2$ and $C_2$ be the centres of $KB$ and $KC$. If we also draw $B_1B_2$ and $C_1C_2$, we see that they contain the common intersection of the tangents as well. The lines $A_1A_2$, $B_1B_2$ and $C_1C_2$ are the bisectors of the inner angles of the triangle $A_1B_1C_1$ and they meet in a point we denote by $J$. We wish to prove that each of the tangents $t_A$, $t_B$ and $t_C$ also contains $J$.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Slovenija_2009_p34_data_f2e999cb5b.png)"

As we have shown before, we can assign the labels as follows: $A_1 = A$, $A_2 = C$, $A_3 = B$ and $A_4 = D$.\n\nAssume that (1) holds and let us show this in the case of $k-1$ tied games. Let us choose a pair of contestants who tied against one another and denote them by $C$ and $D$. The remaining $2k$ contestants can be labeled so that (1) holds. Furthermore, we may also assume that $A_1 \\to C$ (otherwise exchange $C$ and $D$). Since $A_1 = A_{k+1}$, we have $C \\to A_{k+1}$. Let $i$ be the smallest index, such that $C \\to A_{i+1}$. Then $A_i \\to C \\to A_{i+1}$. On the other hand, $A_i = A_{i-k-1}$, $C = D$ and $A_{i+1} = A_{i+k+1}$. As shown above, this implies $A_{i+k} \\to D \\to A_{i+k+1}$.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Slovenija_2009_p38_data_566e9cebc0.png)\n\nLet $B_j = A_j$ for $1 \\le j \\le i$. $B_{i+1} = C$. $B_j = A_{j-1}$ for $j = i+2, \\dots, i+k+1$. $B_{i+k+2} = D$ and $B_j = A_{j-2}$ for $j \\ge i+k+3$. Then\n\n\\[\nB_1 \\to B_2 \\to B_3 \\to \\dots \\to B_{2k+2} \\to B_1 \\text{ and } B_j = B_{j+k+1} \\text{ for } j = 1, \\dots, k+1,\n\\]\n\nwhich is what we wanted to see."

For each $1 \\le i \\le n+1$ the line $A_iA_{i+n+1}$ is obviously a divider. No other line is a divider, so there are exactly $n+1$ of them.\n\nNow, let us show that we can always find at least $n+1$ dividers regardless of the positions of the given points. We will show that there is at least one divider passing through each of the points. Let $A$ be one of the points and denote the remaining points by $A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_{2n+1}$. Consider the lines $AA_1, AA_2, \\dots, AA_{2n+1}$. Let us paint the half-plane on one of the sides of the line $AA_1$ gray. Let $r_1$ be the number of points contained in the gray part (the line $AA_1$ itself does not belong to the gray part).\n\nNow, let us rotate the gray part around $A$ in the positive direction. In each step rotate it so that the image of the gray part borders on the next possible line amongst $AA_1, AA_2, \\dots, AA_{2n+1}$. We may assume that these lines are already ordered, so we get $AA_1, AA_2, \\dots, AA_{2n+1}$ and then again $AA_1$. Let $r_{i+1}$ be the number of the given points in the gray part after $i$ steps.\n\nAssume that at some point we started with the line $AA_i$ and then rotated the gray part so that it is now bordering on the line $AA_{i+1}$. We consider four possible cases for the positions of the points $A_i$ and $A_{i+1}$. If $A_{i+1}$ was initially in the gray part and $A_i$ is there after the rotation, then $r_i = r_{i+1}$. If $A_{i+1}$ was initially in the gray part and $A_i$ is not in the gray part after the rotation, then the number of points in the gray part decreased by 1, so $r_{i+1} = r_i - 1$. If $A_{i+1}$ was initially not in the gray part, then we have $r_{i+1} = r_i$ if $A_i$ is not in the gray part after the rotation. Otherwise we have $r_{i+1} = r_i + 1$.\n\nIn each step the number of points in the gray part changes by at most 1. All these numbers are integers. At the beginning there were $r_1$ points in the gray part. After $2n+1$ rotations we have the situation where the gray part is once more bordering on the line $AA_1$, but it is not on the same side as in the beginning. So, the number of points in the gray part is in the end equal to\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Slovenija_2010_p25_data_b716367c7d.png)\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Slovenija_2010_p25_data_fac0b11f92.png)\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Slovenija_2010_p25_data_a5d1e2401d.png)"

If we draw a figure where $\\angle CBA = 2\\angle ACB$, we notice that $IA_1C_1$ is a right triangle. Let us prove this.\n\nSince $ABA_1B_1$ is a cyclic quadrilateral we have $\\angle C_1A_1I = \\angle B_1A_1A = \\angle B_1BA = \\frac{\\angle BCA}{2} = \\gamma$. The angle $\\angle A_1IC$ is equal to $\\pi - \\angle CIA$.

Thales' theorem states that the circumcentre of the triangle $IA_1C_1$ (i.e. the point S) is the midpoint of the segment $IA_1$. The central angle is twice the inscribed angle, so $\\angle C_1SI = 2\\angle C_1A_1I = 2\\frac{\\angle CBA}{2} = 2\\gamma$. The quadrilateral $ABA_1C_1$ is cyclic, so $\\angle CA_1A = \\angle CBA = 2\\gamma$. Hence, $CA_1$ is parallel to DS. But D is the midpoint of the segment CE and S is the midpoint of the segment $IA_1$, so DS is the midsegment of the quadrilateral $SIA_1C_1$. Since DS is parallel to $CA_1$ it must also be parallel to EI. So, $\\angle EIA = \\angle DSA = 2\\gamma$.\n\nFor the inner angles of the triangle ABI we have $\\angle BAI = \\angle BAC = \\frac{\\pi-3\\gamma}{2} = \\frac{\\pi-3\\gamma}{2} = \\frac{\\pi-3\\gamma}{2} = \\frac{\\pi-3\\gamma}{2}$, $\\angle IBA = \\angle CBA = \\frac{\\pi-3\\gamma}{2} = \\frac{\\pi-3\\gamma}{2} = \\frac{\\pi-3\\gamma}{2} = \\frac{\\pi-3\\gamma}{2}$. Since the sum of the inner angles in an arbitrary triangle is equal to $\\pi$ we get $\\frac{\\pi-3\\gamma}{2} + \\gamma + \\pi - 2\\gamma = \\pi$ or $\\gamma = \\frac{\\pi}{5}$.\n\nThe angles of the triangle ABC measure $\\angle BAC = \\angle CBA = \\frac{2\\pi}{5}$ and $\\angle ACB = \\frac{\\pi}{5}$.",

If $3a < 13$, then it follows from a) that $3a$ is red. We continue in this way to conclude that only the balls numbered by multiples of $a$ are red. Since there are at least two red balls, we have $2a \\le 12$, so $a \\le 6$.\n\nOnly the following colourings are possible:\n\n* all balls are green,\n\n* exactly one ball is red (12 colourings),\n\n* the red balls are exactly the multiples of $a \\le 6$ (there are 6 possible choices for $a$).\n\nThere are 19 colourings altogether.",

We have $9(p^l + 3) - 13 = p^k$ or $14 = p^k - 9p^l = p^l(p^{k-l} - 9)$. If $l = 0$, then $p^k = 23$, so $p = 23$, $k = 1$ and $x = 4$. Else, we have $l \\ge 1$ and $p^l = 14$, so either $p^l = 2$ and $p^{k-l} - 9 = 7$ or $p^l = 7$ and $p^{k-l} - 9 = 2$. In the first case we have $p = 2$, $l = 1$, $k = 5$ and $x = 5$. In the second case there are no solutions.\n\nNow, consider the other system of equations, $9x - 13 = -p^k$ and $x - 3 = -p^l$. Here we have $14 = p^l(9 - p^{k-l})$. The only two possibilities are $p = 2$, $l = 1$ and $p = 7$, $l = 1$ (in this case we cannot have $l = 0$). We get $x = 1$ and $x = -4$."

First suppose that $\\overline{bc}$ is not divisible by 5. Then $\\overline{bc}$ must divide $4a$. Because $\\overline{bc}$ is a 2-digit natural number, $4a$ must also be a 2-digit natural number, hence $3 \\le a \\le 9$. The number $4a$ can thus take values 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32 or 36. 2-digit divisors of these numbers are 12, 16, 20 and 10, 24 and 12, 28 and 14, 32 and 16, 36 and 18 and 12, respectively.

Hence $\\overline{bc} = 10b + 5 = 5(2b + 1)$, from which we conclude that $2b + 1$ must divide $20a$. Because $2b + 1$ is odd, it must divide $5a$. If $2b + 1$ is divisible by 5, we get $b = 2$ (hence $2b + 1 = 5$) and $a$ is arbitrary or $b = 7$ (hence $2b + 1 = 15$) and $a$ is equal to 3, 6 or 9.

It must hold $2b + 1 \\le 9$ and therefore $b \\le 4$ and $b \\ne 2$ (otherwise we would have $2b + 1 = 5$). If $b$ is successively equal to 4, 3 and 1, then $a$ can be successively equal to 9, 7 and 3 or 6 or 9. We get the following solutions: 945, 735, 315, 615 and 915."

The numerator of the above fraction thus contains a sum of an odd number of odd numbers, which again is an odd number.

          "latex": "d must divide 5. First, let us assume that $d = 1$. Then the equation can be rearranged into $a(2b - 1) = 3b + 6$. From here we conclude that $2b - 1$ divides $3b + 6$, so it must also divide $2(3b + 6) - 3(2b - 1) = 15$. Since $2b - 1$ is a positive integer there are four possibilities. If $2b - 1 = 1$, then $b = 1$ and $a = 9$. If $2b - 1 = 3$, then $b = 2$ and $a = 4$, which leads to a contradiction, since $a$ and $b$ should be relatively prime. If $2b - 1 = 5$, then $b = 3$ and $a = 3$, which is again a contradiction. Finally, if $2b - 1 = 15$, then $b = 8$ and $a = 2$, and once more this is not possible. Hence, in this case we only have one solution, (9, 1). Now, assume that $d = 5$. Then we can divide the equation by 5 and rearrange it to get $a(2b - 1) = 3b + 10$. This implies that $2b - 1$ divides $3b + 10$, so it must also divide $2(3b + 10) - 3(2b - 1) = 23$. There are two possibilities. If $2b - 1 = 1$, then $b = 1$ and $a = 13$. If $2b - 1 = 23$, then $b = 12$ and $a = 2$, a contradiction once more. In this case we get the solution (65, 5).",

In this case exactly 2 would have to carry over from ones to tens, which would mean $a+b+c+2=8+c<20$, and thus at most 1 would carry over from tens to hundreds, which yields a contradiction.

Since $101$ is a prime number we have $(2l+1)|101$ and we can write $101 = (2l+1)c$, where $c \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Since $2l+1 > 1$ we must have $c=1$ and $2l+1 = 101$. From this we deduce $l=50$ and $b = 50^2 = 2500$, and also $a = 2601$.",
