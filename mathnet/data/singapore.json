But then $x = y+z$, and $y, z > 0$ imply that $y, z < x$, a contradiction. Hence $F$ contains negative elements. A similar argument shows that $F$ contains positive elements.\n\nPick any positive element of $F$ and label it as $x_1$. Assume that positive elements of $F$, $x_1, \\dots, x_k$, have been chosen. We can write $x_k = y + z$, where $y, z \\in F$. We may assume that $y > 0$. Label $y$ as $x_{k+1}$.

Inductively, suppose $x < p+q-1$ and there is a collection of $x$ boxes with $x-1$ internal bags and 1 external bag. By putting the box that contains the external bag into the collection, we have a collection of $x+1$ boxes with $x$ internal bags. Since $x+1 < p+q$, the collection also has an external bag. This can continue until $x = p+q-1$. For this collection, we have $x-1$ internal and 1 external bag giving a total $x = p+q-1$ bags. Thus $n \\ge p+q-1$.\n\nNext we shall show that $n = p+q-1$ is sufficient. Apply the division algorithm, assuming that $p > q$, we have $p = kq+r$ where $0 \\le r < q-1$. Suppose that we have solved the problem for $(q, r)$, i.e., we have $q+r-1$ bags containing a total of $qr$ objects and these bags can be distributed into $q$ red boxes, $R_1, \\dots, R_q$ with $r$ objects in each box and into $r$ blue boxes, $B_1, \\dots, B_r$, with $q$ objects in each box. Now add another $kq$ bags with $q$ objects in each bag. We have a total $kq + q + r - 1 = p + q - 1$ bags with a total of $kq^2 + qr = pq$ objects. Put each of these new bags into a new blue box, then, together with $B_1, \\dots, B_r$, we have $kq + r = p$ blue boxes each with $q$ objects. Next into each of the red boxes $R_1, \\dots, R_q$, put $k$ of these new bags so that each box has $kq + r = p$ objects. Thus we have a solution for $(p, q)$. Since $p, q$ are coprime, applying the division algorithm repeatedly, we eventually get to the situation where $r=1$. For the solution to the problem with $q \\times 1$ objects, we simply put 1 object in each bag.\n\nFor $p=43, q=17$, we have $43 = 2 \\times 17 + 9$, $17 = 1 \\times 9 + 8$, $9 = 1 \\times 8 + 1$. Thus our solution is 8 bags with 1 object, 8 bags with 8 objects, 9 bags with 9 objects, 34 bags with 17 objects.\n\n**Note:** In general, for any $p, q$, the number bags is $p+q-\\gcd(p, q)$. Let $d = \\gcd(p, q)$. For any collection of $a$ red bags and $b$ blue boxes with no external bag, we have $pa =qb$. Dividing by $d$, we have $a(p/d) = b(q/d)$. Since $p/d$ and $q/d$ are coprime, we have $a = kq/d$ and $b = kp/d$. Thus number of bags is minimized when $k=1$ for all such collections. Thus $n \\ge p+q-d$. The sufficiency part can be established using the division algorithm.",

We say that a bag is internal (with respect to the collection) if it is contained in a red box and a blue box in the collection. It is external if it is contained in only one of the boxes in the collection. If the collection does not have any external bags, then $rq = bp$. Since $p, q$ are coprime, we have $r = p, b = q$. This means any collection of $x$ boxes, with $x < p+q$, must have an external bag.\n\nWe shall prove that for every $x < p+q$, there is a collection of $r$ red and $b$ blue boxes with $r+b = x$ that has at least $x-1$ internal bags and at least 1 external bag.

We first show that there is an AP $[a, d]$ that contains $X_i$, i.e. $X_i = a + k_i d$, $i = 1, ..., 5$. For example we can take $a = d = 1$. Choose such an AP with maximal $d$. Then not all $k_i$ can be even, or else we can use the AP $[a, 2d]$, contradicting the choice of $d$. Also not all $k_i$ can be odd or else we can use $[a+d, 2d]$. We have two cases. (i) At least 3 of $k_1, ..., k_5$ are odd: use $[a+d, 2d]$. (ii) At least 3 of $k_1, ..., k_5$ are even: use $[a, 2d]$. In either case, we have an AP $[a', d']$ that contains exactly 3 or 4 of $X_1, ..., X_5$. Note that $[a', d']$ is a 'sub-AP' of $[a, d]$.\n\nNext we show that there is AP that contains exactly 3 or 4 of $X_1, ..., X_6$.

All balls with even labels must then be put into the same box that the ball labelled 2 goes. Thus any ball with label which has a common factor greater than 1 with anyone of those even labels must be put into the same box too. Therefore, we only need to consider those balls with labels greater than 50. That leaves with 10 balls labelled by the primes: 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97. Thus we have twelve entities, namely the ten prime numbers, the number 1 and all the balls that must go with 2. Each can be put into any of the two boxes. Taking away the 2 cases where one of the boxes is empty, the number ways is $2^{12} - 2 = 4094$. Since the two boxes are identical, we need to divide this number by 2. Therefore the answer is 2047.",

It suffices to prove for $n = t^2 + 1$ that we require $t$ bridges to be destroyed. Consider $t$ islands in a row, with each pair of adjacent islands connected by a bridge. We call such a configuration a \"line\". Take $t$ distinct lines, and then connect each end of a line to a new island, called $X$. We then have $t^2 + 1$ islands with $t^2$ bridges. Let the fire starts at $X$. After $t-1$ nights only $t-1$ bridges can be destroyed. So the bridges of one line along with the bridge to $X$, remain untouched and the fire can still spread to the last island on the line.\n\nNow we show that given a connected configuration of $n$ islands with $n-1$ bridges, such that there are $k$ unburnt islands and that the burnt islands are connected, let $f(k)$ be the minimum number of bridges we have to destroy before the fire stops spreading. Then $f(k) \\le [\\sqrt{k}]$. Noting that the burnt islands are connected because it spreads from an island to islands connected to it, the result then follows by taking $k = n-1$. We proceed by induction.\n\nClearly $f(1) = 1$. Now suppose the result holds for all integers $< k$. Removing all the burnt islands so far gives us say $l$ disjoint components of islands that are unburnt. Since there are $k$ unburnt islands, one of this component has at least $s = [k/l]$ islands. Destroy the bridge that connects this component to the burnt islands. Then the next morning, for each of the other $l-1$ components, the fire spreads to one island. The burnt islands remain connected. Now we have $k-s-l+1$ unburnt islands. By induction, we can stop the fire with an additional\n\n$$\nf(k-s-1+l) \\le f([k-s-l+1]) \\le f([k-\\sqrt{2k}+1]) = f([\\sqrt{k}-1]^2) \\le [\\sqrt{k}]-1\n$$\n"

          "latex": "**Claim:** Among the numbers written over $4m$ minutes, there is either (a) two numbers that sum to a multiple of $m$, or (b) a number which is a multiple or half-multiple of $m$.\n\n**Proof of Claim:** Suppose Bob starts at integer lattice point $(u,v) = (u_0, v_0) \\equiv (y_0, -x_0) \\pmod{m}$. Each minute, if Alice moves right, Bob moves down; if Alice moves up, Bob moves right.\n\nIn this manner, Alice's and Bob's coordinates are always related by $(u,v) \\equiv (y,-x) \\pmod{m}$. In particular, whenever Alice writes down the number $f(x,y)$, Bob writes down the number $f(u,v) \\equiv -f(x,y) \\pmod{m}$.\n\nIt suffices to show that Alice's and Bob's paths coincide on some lattice point $(x^*, y^*)$. If this occurs, then either\n\n1. (a) Alice and Bob reach $(x^*, y^*)$ at different times, thus Alice has written down $f(x^*, y^*)$ and $-f(x^*, y^*)$ (mod $m$) at two different times; or\n\n2. (b) Alice and Bob reach $(x^*, y^*)$ at the same time; thus $f(x^*, y^*) \\equiv -f(x^*, y^*)$ (mod $m$), so Alice has written down a multiple or half-multiple of $m$.\n\nWLOG among Alice's first $2m-1$ moves, she moves right at least $m$ times (the alternative is that she moves up at least $m$ times, in which case a similar argument holds by swapping the axes).\n\nThen, within Alice's first $2m-1$ moves, she passes through some lattice point $(u_0, w_0)$, where $x_0 < u_0 \\le x_0 + m$ and $u_0 \\equiv y_0 \\pmod m$. We then select Bob's starting point as $(u_0, v_0)$ where $w_0 < v_0 \\le w_0 + m$ and $v_0 \\equiv -x_0 \\pmod m$.\n\nConsequently, the path $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{Bob}}$ traversed by Bob within his first $2m-1$ moves starts vertically above $(u_0, w_0)$, and at distance $\\le m$ from $(u_0, w_0)$. Since Bob moves down at least $m$ times and moves right at most $m-1$ times within his first $2m-1$ moves, his path $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{Bob}}$ traverses within the upper-right quadrant $\\{(x, y) : x \\ge u_0, y \\ge w_0\\}$ with respect to $(u_0, w_0)$, and leaves the quadrant from the bottom edge at a distance $\\le m$ from $(u_0, w_0)$ (see Figure 1).\n\nThus, a further $2m$ moves by Alice starting from $(u_0, w_0)$ will take her from below $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{Bob}}$ to above it, guaranteeing a lattice point intersection with $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{Bob}}$.\n\nSince two multiples of $m$ or two half-multiples of $m$ sum to a multiple of $m$, thus by the claim, Alice is guaranteed to write two numbers that sum to a multiple of $m$ within $3 \\cdot 4m = 12m$ moves.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/combined_25__latex_1_p7_data_b4bacd4410.png)\n\nFigure 1: Sample game for $m=6$. Alice's path is lightly shaded and starts at $(x_0, y_0) = (2, 1)$ which is at the bottom. Bob's path is heavily shaded and starts at $(u_0, v_0) = (7, 10)$ at the top. Alice's path after $(u_0, w_0)$ which is at the bottom left corner of the box, is guaranteed to intersect Bob's path; the intersection is the square with 2. When Bob is at the intersection, Alice has also made 5 moves is at the square with 4. The numbers written by Alice in these 2 squares sum to a multiple of $m=6$.",
