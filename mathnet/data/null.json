Let $X$ be an arbitrary set of $9m$ different points on a plane, and $Y$ — the set of subsets of $X$ of size $6m + 1$.\n\nSuppose that there exist such $A, B, C \\in Y$ that their intersection is empty. Let's enumerate all points in $X$ by numbers from 1 to $9m$. Let's write down on a sheet of paper the numbers of points in $A$, then the numbers of points in $B$, and after that the numbers of points in $C$. We wrote $|A| + |B| + |C| = 18m + 3$ numbers in total. Since these sets do not intersect, then we couldn't write any number more than twice. Thus, we wrote no more than $2 \\cdot 9m = 18m$ numbers — a contradiction. Therefore, any three elements of $Y$ intersect.\n\nSince the convex hull of a set of points contains the set itself, then the convex hulls of any three elements of $Y$ intersect. According to Helly's theorem, the convex hulls of all elements of $Y$ share some common point $O$.\n\nLet's prove the following \\textbf{lemma}: if the convex hull of a finite set of points $Z$ contains some point $P$, then there exists such $W \\subseteq Z$ that $|W| \\le 3$ and the convex hull of $W$ contains $P$. By definition of convex hull, there exists a convex polygon with the set of vertices $V \\subseteq Z$ (possibly, degenerate) that contains $P$. If $|V| \\le 3$, then $V$ works as $W$. Otherwise, let's perform an arbitrary triangulation of the polygon with vertices in $V$. Point $P$ has to lie in at least one of the obtained triangles. The set of vertices of such triangle works as $W$.\n\nSuppose we have a bag into which we can put non-empty subsets of $X$. Let's denote the following operation, which modifies $X$ and $Y$: take any $A \\in Y$. Since the convex hull of $A$ contains $O$, then, according to the lemma, there exists such $B \\subseteq A$ that $|B| \\le 3$ and the convex hull of $B$ contains $O$. Let's put $B$ into our bag (obviously, $B$ is non-empty), delete elements of $B$ from $X$, and delete sets from $Y$ that contain element of $B$.\n\nAfter one such operation the size of $X$ decreases by at most three, and $Y$ remains non-empty as long as $|X| \\ge 6m + 1$. Therefore, we can perform the operation at least $m$ times. Let's perform it exactly $m$ times. Distribute the remaining elements of $X$ randomly among the sets in the bag.\n\nSo, the sets in the bag constitute a partition of the initial set of points into $m$ non-empty sets and the convex hull of each of them contains point $O$, which is what we wanted.",

Therefore, the problem implies that $k$ divides both $n-m+1$ and $n-m+2$, which is possible for $k=1$ only.

The division of all the four numbers by $d$ preserves the validity of our equations. Since $x, y, z, t$ are not zero, we can divide them by their greatest common divisor and henceforth assume that they are coprime.\n\nThe numbers $x$ and $y$ can not be both odd (since $xy$ is even) or both even (since in this case $zt$ is also even and at least three of the numbers $x, y, z, t$ are even). Thus $x$ and $y$ and therefore $z$ and $t$ have different parity.\n\nDenote $s = x^2 + y^2$, $n = zt$. Without loss of generality, $n > 0$.\n\nThe condition on $x, y, z, t$ means that $s - 4n, s - 2n, s + 2n, s + 4n$ are perfect squares. We will prove that this is not possible for any odd $s$ and positive $n$. First, we find a statement equivalent to these four numbers being squares. Their product $(s^2 - 4n^2)(s^2 - 16n^2) = (s^2 - 10n^2)^2 - 36n^4$ is a square of some odd $T$. The numbers $T, 6n^2, s^2 - 10n^2$ form a primitive Pythagorean triple, hence there exist coprime $u, v$ of different parity such that $2uv = 6n^2$ and $u^2 + v^2 = s^2 - 10n^2$. Since $u$ and $v$ are coprime, it follows from $uv = 3n^2$ that one of these numbers is a square and another is a triple square. Without loss of generality, assume that $u = 3k^2$ and $v = l^2$; $k$ and $l$ are coprime. Multiplying $u^2 + v^2 = s^2 - 10n^2$ by 3 we get $3s^2 - 30n^2 = 3s^2 - 10uv = 3u^2 + 3v^2$, that is, $3s^2 = 3u^2 + 10uv + 3v^2 = (3u + v)(3v + u)$, where $3u + v$ and $3v + u$ are coprime (they have different parity, and their common divisor must also divide $8u = 3(3u + v) - (3v + u)$ and, similarly, $8v$). It follows that one of the numbers $3u + v$ and $3v + u$ is a square and another is a triple square. Since 3 does not divide $3u + v$, the square is $3u + v = 9k^2 + l^2$, and the triple square is $u + 3v = 3(k^2 + l^2)$. We have proved that the original equations imply the existence of coprime $k$ and $l$ such that $9k^2 + l^2$ and $k^2 + l^2$ are perfect squares.\n\nIt remains to prove that there are no such $k, l$. If $k^2 + l^2$ and $9k^2 + l^2$ are perfect squares, the pairs $(k, l)$ and $(3k, l)$ are pairs of legs in primitive Pythagorean triples. Unfortunately, we do not know which of the numbers $k$ and $l$ is even, so two cases are possible. But let's prove the following lemma first.\n\nLemma. Let $a, b, c, d$ be pairwise coprime positive integers such that $c^2(a^2 + d^2) = b^2(9a^2 + d^2)$. Then, $a^2 + d^2$ and $9a^2 + d^2$ are perfect squares.\n\nProof. Since $\\text{GCD}(b, c) = 1$, then there exists such positive integer $f$ that\n\n$$\na^2 + d^2 = b^2 f, \\quad 9a^2 + d^2 = c^2 f.\n$$\n\n$$\nf = \\text{GCD}(a^2 + d^2, 9a^2 + d^2) \\implies f \\mid 8a^2, \\quad f \\mid 8d^2.\n$$\n\n$$\n\\text{GCD}(a, d) = 1 \\implies f \\mid 8.\n$$\n\nIf $a, d$ are of different parity, then $a^2 + d^2$ is odd, and therefore $f = 1$. Let both $a$ and $d$ be odd (they can't be simultaneously even). Then\n\n$$\na^2 + d^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{8} \\implies f \\mid 2.\n$$\n\nLet $f = 2$.\n\n$$\n9a^2 + d^2 = c^2 f = 2c^2 \\implies d^2 \\equiv 2c^2 \\pmod{3} \\implies 3 \\mid c, \\quad 3 \\mid d\n$$\n\n— a contradiction, since $\\text{GCD}(c, d) = 1$. Thus, $f = 1, a^2 + d^2 = b^2, 9a^2 + d^2 = c^2$. The lemma is proven.\n\nCase 1. $k$ is even. Then $k = 2u_1v_1$, $3k = 2u_2v_2$, $\\ell = u_1^2 - v_1^2 = u_2^2 - v_2^2$, where $(u_1, v_1)$ and $(u_2, v_2)$ are two pairs of coprime numbers with different parity. Since $u_2v_2 = 3u_1v_1$, then there exist pairwise coprime positive integers $a, b, c, d$ such that $u_2 = 3ab$, $v_2 = cd$, $u_1 = ac$, $v_1 = bd$ (the case when $u_2$ is not divisible by 3 can be considered similarly). Substituting this in the expression for $\\ell$ we obtain $a^2c^2 + c^2d^2 = 9a^2d^2 + d^2c^2$, or $c^2(a^2 + d^2) = d^2(9a^2 + c^2)$. According to the lemma, $a^2 + d^2$ and $9a^2 + c^2$ are squares, and, obviously, $a < k, d < \\ell$.\n\nCase 2. $\\ell$ is even. Then $k = u_1^2 - v_1^2$, $3k = u_2^2 - v_2^2$, $\\ell = 2u_1v_1 = 2u_2v_2$. Since $(u_2 - v_2)(u_2 + v_2) = 3(u_1 - v_1)(u_1 + v_1)$, then we have $u_1 - v_1 = ab$, $u_1 + v_1 = cd$, $u_2 - v_2 = ac$, $u_2 + v_2 = 3bd$ for some pairwise coprime positive integers $a, b, c, d$ (the case when $u_2 + v_2$ is not divisible by 3 can be considered similarly). Expressing $u_1, v_1, u_2, v_2$ in terms of $a, b, c, d$ and putting the result in the formula for $\\ell$, we get $(ab+cd)(cd-ab) = (3bd+ac)(3bd-ac)$, that is, $c^2(a^2+d^2) = b^2(a^2+9d^2)$. Hence, by the lemma, we obtain that $a^2+d^2$ and $a^2+9d^2$ are perfect squares, and $a<\\ell, d<k$.\n\nIn both cases, for each pair $(k, \\ell)$ such that $k^2 + \\ell^2$ and $9k^2 + \\ell^2$ are perfect squares we constructed a pair of smaller numbers with the same property. It follows that such numbers do not exist. Thus, the original system does not admit a solution in non-zero integers.",

          "latex": "Let the alphabet consist of letters $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{25}$. By a \\textit{piece} we always mean a piece of the strip containing exactly 17 consecutive letters; different pieces may contain the same word. Say that a piece is \\textit{singular} if the word it contains is such.\n\nWe start with constructing an example containing $N = 2 \\cdot 5^{17}$ singular words. Define a word $W = a_1a_2 \\dots a_{17}$; this will be the word having $k = 5^{16}$ non-overlapping copies on the strip. There exist exactly $25^8 = k$ possible 8-letter sequences, consisting of letters $a_{18}, a_{19}, \\dots, a_{25}$; put them onto the strip in an arbitrary order, separating each two sequences by an instance of $W$. Each segment of the strip containing one 8-sequence mentioned above (and no other letters) will be referred to as a \\textit{part}. Notice that the strip contains exactly $(8+17)k = 5^{18}$ letters.\n\nClearly, the obtained strip contains $k$ non-overlapping copies of $W$. Now we show that any piece containing a whole part is singular — moreover, that the word it contains is met on no other piece. Since a part can be situated in a piece at 10 different positions (starting from the 1-st, from the 2-nd, ..., or from the 10-th letter of a piece), we will get that there are at least $10 \\cdot 5^{16} = N$ singular words.\n\nConsider an arbitrary piece $p$ containing a word $P$. Either this piece contains a unique nonempty prefix which coincides with some suffix of $W$, or there is no such prefix — only in this case we will say that such prefix is empty. Let $b$ be the length of the defined prefix. Define similarly a suffix of $P$ which coincides with a prefix of $W$, and denote its length by $e$. Notice that the defined prefix and suffix do not overlap whenever $P \\neq W$ (if $P = W$, we have $b = e = 17$).\n\nIf the piece contains no whole part, then $\\max\\{b, e\\} > 9$. If the piece contains a part, then $b + e = 9$ and $0 \\le b, e \\le 9$. Thus, piece $p$ contains a part if and only if $\\max\\{b, e\\} \\le 9$, and in this case the position of the part at $P$ (and hence the position of $p$ at the strip) is uniquely determined. Therefore, in this case $P$ is met only on piece $p$, so this piece is singular. We have proven that the constructed example works.\n\nIt remains to prove that the number of singular words cannot exceed $N$. Enumerate the positions in the strip successively by 1, 2, ..., $5^{18}$ (the numeration is cyclic modulo $5^{18}$). Let $p_i$ denote the piece starting at position $i$, and let $P_i$ be the word on that piece. Let $n_1, \\dots, n_k$ be positions such that the pieces $p_{n_1}, p_{n_2}, \\dots, p_{n_k}$ are pairwise disjoint and contain the same word $W$ (from the problem statement). Clearly, those pieces are not singular.\n\nFor $i = 1, 2, \\dots, 8$ and $1 \\le s \\le k$, we say that a piece $p_{n_s+i}$ is a \\textit{rank i follower}, while $p_{n_s-i}$ is a \\textit{rank i predecessor}. All these pieces (followers and predecessors) are distinct; moreover, followers of a fixed rank are pairwise disjoint, and the same holds for predecessors. We will show that \\textit{among} $8 \\cdot 5^{16}$ \\textit{followers of all ranks}, \\textit{at most} $5^{16}$ pieces are singular (we will call this statement a \\textit{quoted claim} in the future); by symmetry, the same bound holds for predecessors. This will yield that there are at least $5^{16} + 7 \\cdot 5^{16} + 7 \\cdot 5^{16} = 3 \\cdot 5^{17}$ non-singular pieces, which implies the desired bound.\n\nThus, we are left to prove the claim quoted above. For any rank $i$ follower $p_{n_s+i}$ define its \\textit{tail} as its suffix of length $i$ (the tail consists of all letters which do not lie in $p_{n_s}$; we regard a tail as a sequence of letters). We show by induction on $m = 0, 1, \\dots, 8$ that for every sequence $U$ consisting of $(8-m)$ letters, there are no more than $25^m$ followers whose tails contain $U$ as a prefix. The desired claim is obtained by setting $m = 8$.\n\nThe base case $m=0$ is obvious: if a follower with tail $U$ is singular, then there is only one such follower. Let us perform the inductive step. If there is no singular follower whose tail is $U$, then every singular follower's tail starting with $U$ starts in fact with some word of the form $Ua_i$. For every $i = 1, 2, \\dots, 25$, there are at most $25^{m-1}$ such followers, by the inductive hypothesis. So the total number of such followers does not exceed $25 \\cdot 25^{m-1} = 25^m$, as desired.\n\nFinally, if there is a singular follower $P_{n_s+8-m}$ whose tail is $U$, then such follower is unique. Therefore, all followers of larger ranks whose tails start with $U$ correspond to the same copy $p_{n_s}$ of $W$. Then the number of such followers (including $P_{n_s+8-m}$ itself) is at most $m+1 \\le 25^m$, as desired again. The claim, and the bound, are proven.\n\n\\textbf{Remark.} We present a shorter (yet more ideological) proof of the quoted claim on the number of singular followers. Say that a singular follower's tail $T$ is \\textit{minimal} if none of its proper prefixes is a singular follower's tail. In particular, no minimal tail can be a proper prefix of other minimal tail.\n\nFor every minimal tail $T$ let us write down all 8-letter sequences starting with $T$; if the length of $T$ is $d$, then the number of such sequences is $25^{8-d}$. No sequence could be written down twice; therefore, if there are $M$ minimal tails of lengths $d_1, \\dots, d_M$, then\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{M} 25^{8-d_i} \\le 25^8.\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, each singular follower's tail has a prefix which is a minimal tail. For a minimal tail $T$ of length $d$, there are at most $9-d$ singular followers whose tails start with $T$ — at most one per tail's length. Therefore, the number of singular followers does not exceed\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{M} (9 - d_i) \\le \\sum_{i=1}^{M} 25^{8-d_i} \\le 25^8,\n$$\n\nsince $9 - d \\le 25^{8-d}$ for all $d = 1, 2, \\dots, 8$.",

Then we have $b = a - (a-b) \\equiv a \\pmod d$ and $-(a+b+1) = a - (2a+b+1) \\equiv a \\pmod d$. This means that, on each move, all three numbers on the blackboard increased by $a$ modulo $d$ (or, conversely, decreased by $a$ modulo $d$). Hence, if the three numbers written by Basil are not all congruent modulo $d$, then this property will be preserved during Pete's moves, so that they will never be all equal (so they will never become all zero).\n\n(b) Let $x, y, z$ be three numbers on the blackboard at some moment. Then Pete can perform, by several moves, any of the following operations:\n\n1. To yield numbers $x + (a-b)$, $y - (a-b)$, and $z$. For this purpose, he can add $a$ to the first number and $b$ to the second number, and then subtract $a$ from the second number and $b$ from the first one.\n\n2. To yield numbers $x - (2a + b + 1)$, $y + (2a + b + 1)$, and $z$. For that, he can subtract $a$ from the first number and add $a+b+1$ to the second one, and then subtract $a+b+1$ from the first number and add $a$ to the second one.\n\n3. To yield numbers $x + 1$, $y - 1$, $z$. Indeed, since $2a + b + 1$ and $a - b$ are coprime, there exist positive integers $u$ and $v$ such that $u(a - b) - v(2a + b + 1) = 1$. Applying operation 1 $u$ times and operation 2 $v$ times, Pete gets the desired situation.\n\n4. Pete can, by one move, either decrease the sum of all numbers by 1 (using the first described move) or increase that sum by 1 (using the second move).\n\nPerforming operations 3 and 4, Pete can reach his goal: first, using operation 4, he gets three numbers summing up to zero; then, using operation 3, he makes one number on the blackboard zero, and then another number becomes zero. Since the sum of numbers on the blackboard does not change during these operations, the third number also vanishes at the end. $\\square$\n\nDue to the lemma, an odd number $a > 1$ satisfies the requirements if and only if the following condition holds:\n\n(*) For every even $b < a$, the numbers $a-b$ and $2a+b+1$ are coprime.\n\nNotice that\n\n$$\ngcd(a - b, 2a + b + 1) = gcd(a - b, 2a + b + 1 + (a - b)) = gcd(a - b, 3a + 1).\n$$\n\nNotice also that the number $a-b$ runs over all odd positive integers smaller than $a$. Therefore, property (*) is equivalent to the fact that the number $3a+1$ is coprime to any odd positive integer smaller than $a$; or, in other words, that $3a+1$ has no odd divisors smaller than $a$ and greater than $1$ — let us call such divisors \\textit{bad}.\n\nNotice that the number $3a+1$ is even; then $3a+1 = 2^k\\ell$, where $k$ is a positive integer, and $\\ell$ is an odd positive integer. If $k \\ge 2$ and $\\ell > 1$, then $\\ell \\le \\frac{3a+1}{4} < a$ is a bad divisor. If $\\ell$ is composite, i.e., $\\ell = \\ell_1\\ell_2$ with $\\ell_1, \\ell_2 \\ge 3$, then $\\ell_1 = \\frac{3a+1}{2^k\\ell_2} \\le \\frac{3a+1}{6} < a$ is a bad divisor.\n\nThe remaining cases are (1) $\\ell = 1$, and (2) $k = 1$ and $\\ell$ is a prime number. It is easy to see that, in both cases, $3a+1$ has no bad divisors. Therefore, the desired cases are precisely $3a+1 = 2^k$ and $3a+1 = 2p$, where $p$ is a prime. Checking modulo 3 it follows that $k$ is even in the former case, and $\\ell$ has a remainder 2 when divided by 3 in the latter. The result follows.",

A sum of such fractions is congruent to $0 \\pmod{p}$ if and only if $p$ divides the numerator of the (reduced) sum of respective usual fractions. We shall prove the statement through the following claims;\n\n\\textbf{Claim 1.} For a given integer $r$, the number of positive integers $n < p$ such that $1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{n} \\equiv r \\pmod{p}$ is not greater than $\\frac{3}{2}p^{\\frac{2}{3}}$.\n\nLet $n_1 < n_2 < \\cdots < n_{s+1}$ be all such $n$. Every integer $k$ appears at most $k-1$ times among the differences $n_{i+1} - n_i$ (since $n_i$ should be a root of the congruence\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x+1} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{x+k} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}\n$$\n\nhaving at most $k-1$ roots: its left-hand side becomes a polynomial of degree $k-1$ when multiplied by the denominator).\n\nConsider the largest $m$ such that $1+2+\\cdots+(m-1) = \\frac{m(m-1)}{2} \\le s$. Then $s < \\frac{m(m+1)}{2}$. On the other hand, $n_{s+1}-n_1$ is the sum of $s$ differences $n_{i+1}-n_i$, and\n\n$$\np > n_{s+1} - n_1 \\ge 1 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 3 + \\cdots + (m-1)m = \\frac{m^3 - m}{3}.\n$$\n\nIf $m \\le 3$, the number of $n_i$, that is, $s+1$, is not greater than $6 = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 8^{2/3} < \\frac{3}{2}p^{\\frac{2}{3}}$. And, for $m > 3$ we have\n\n$$\ns + 1 \\le \\frac{m(m+1)}{2} < \\frac{3}{2} \\left( \\frac{m^3 - m}{3} \\right)^{2/3} < \\frac{3}{2} p^{2/3}.\n$$\n\n(The middle inequality $m(m+1) < 3 \\left(\\frac{m^3-m}{3}\\right)^{2/3}$ follows from $m^3(m+1)^3 < 3(m^3-m)^2$, i. e., $m^2+m < 3(m-1)^2$.)\n\n\\textbf{Claim 2.} The number of good $n$ less than $p^k$ is not greater than $(\\frac{3}{2}p^{\\frac{2}{3}})^k$.\n\nThis can be proved by induction on $k$. The base case $k=1$ is given by Claim 1 for $r=0$. Note that for a good $n=c+n'p$, $0 \\le c < p$, the number $n' = c_1+\\cdots+c_{k-1}p^{k-2}$ is also good. Indeed, in the sum $1+\\frac{1}{2}+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{n}$ all the terms with denominators divisible by $p$ make together $\\frac{1}{p}(1+\\frac{1}{2}+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{n'})$, and since the remaining sum has no $p$ in the denominator, the irreducible form of $\\frac{1}{p}(1+\\frac{1}{2}+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{n'})$, too, should not have $p$ in the denominator).\n\nThe number of good $n'$ does not exceed $(\\frac{3}{2}p^{\\frac{2}{3}})^{k-1}$ by the induction hypothesis. For each good $n'$ we set $-r \\equiv 1+\\frac{1}{2}+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{n-c_0}$ (mod $p$); the sum of $c$ last terms in the sum $1+\\frac{1}{2}+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{n}$ should be $r$ (mod $p$). By Claim 1, there are at most $\\frac{3}{2}p^{\\frac{2}{3}}$ such $c$, which gives the desired bound.\n\nTurning to the main claim, we choose an integer $k$ such that $p^{k-1} < N \\le p^k$. The number of good numbers not exceeding $N$ is not greater than the number of good numbers not exceeding $p^k$, and this in its turn does not exceed\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{3}{2}p^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\right)^k < \\left(200^{\\frac{1}{12}}p^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\right)^k = \\left(p^{\\frac{1}{12}}p^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\right)^k = p^{\\frac{3}{4}k} = p^{\\frac{3}{4}}(p^{k-1})^{\\frac{3}{4}} < p^{\\frac{3}{4}}N^{\\frac{3}{4}},\n$$\n\nwhich proves the desired claim for $C = p^{\\frac{3}{4}}$ (here we use the inequality $(\\frac{3}{2})^{12} < 200$).",
