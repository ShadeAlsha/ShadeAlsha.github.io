If we cannot reassign any question from $S_x$ to $S_z$, then we will try to reassign a question $Q'$ from $S_x$ to $S_y$, and also reassign a question $Q''$ from $S_y$ to $S_z$ (and, of course, assign $Q$ to $S_x$). If this is not possible for any $Q''$ either, then $w_z \\ge 1341$, a contradiction."

Now we will show that this can be done if there are five students.\n\nAssume that there are five students $S_i$, $1 \\le i \\le 5$, in the class.

Since we have three students, $Q$ is solved by at least one of them. If there is a student who solved $Q$ and has less than 670 questions assigned to her up to this point, we assign $Q$ to her. If this is not the case, then will proceed as follows.\n\n* If $S_x$ is the only student who solved $Q$, but she has already 670 questions assigned to her, and both $S_y$ and $S_z$ have less than 670 questions assigned to them, then we will reassign one of the questions $Q'$ from $S_x$ to $S_y$ or $S_z$, and assign $Q$ to $S_x$.

If we cannot reassign any question from $S_x$ to $S_z$, then we will try to reassign a question $Q'$ from $S_x$ to $S_y$, and also reassign a question $Q''$ from $S_y$ to $S_z$ (and, of course, assign $Q$ to $S_x$).

If $m < n$, then\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nf\\left(\\frac{m}{n}\\right) &= f\\left(\\frac{m/(n-m)}{m/(n-m)+1}\\right) = \\frac{1}{m/(n-m)+1} f\\left(\\frac{m}{n-m}\\right) \\\\\n&= \\frac{n-m}{n} \\cdot \\frac{m^2}{n-m} f(1) = \\frac{m^2}{n} f(1)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nwhere we used the induction hypothesis. On the other hand, if $m > n$, then first\n\n\\[\nf\\left(\\frac{m}{n}\\right) = \\frac{m^3}{n^3} f\\left(\\frac{n}{m}\\right), \\text{ and then } \\frac{m^3}{n^3} f\\left(\\frac{n}{m}\\right) = \\frac{m^3}{n^3} \\cdot \\frac{n^2}{m} f(1) = \\frac{m^2}{n} f(1).\n\\]\n\nConversely, it can be easily verified that the function defined by $f(\\frac{m}{n}) = \\frac{m^2}{n}$ for all relatively prime positive integers $m$ and $n$, where $r$ a positive rational number, satisfies the conditions of the question."

For $n=2$, it is clear that $k$ is at most 1. For $n=3$, it is easy to check that $k \\le 3$. Let us assume that the answer is $2n-5$ for $n-1 \\ge 3$. Let $M = \\{A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_k\\}$ be a maximal collection satisfying the conditions for $n$. By the example above, $k \\ge 2n-3$. Note that neither $\\emptyset$ nor $E$ is in $M$. If none of $\\{i\\}$ and $\\{i\\}'$ is in $M$ for some $1 \\le i \\le n$, then we could add one of them and enlarge the collection. Clearly both $\\{i\\}$ and $\\{i\\}'$ can not be in $M$ and hence exactly one of $\\{i\\}$ and $\\{i\\}'$ belongs to $M$ for all $1 \\le i \\le n$.\n\nObserve that if $X \\in M$, then we can replace it by $X'$. Therefore we may assume that $|A_i| \\le \\frac{n}{2}$ for all $1 \\le i \\le n$.\n\nNow let us choose a set $A \\in M$ such that $|A| \\ge 2$ and $|A| \\le |B|$ for all $B \\in M$ with $|B| \\ge 2$. Since $2n-3 > n$, there exists at least one such set. Without loss of generality we may assume that $1, 2 \\in A$. Then consider any set $B$ in $M$ other than $\\{1\\}, \\{2\\}$ and $A$. If $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$, then $1, 2 \\notin B$.\n\nIf $A \\cap B' = \\emptyset$, then $A \\subset B$ and hence $1, 2 \\in B$.\n\nIf $A' \\cap B = \\emptyset$, then $B \\subset A$ and hence $|B| = 1$ by the choice of $A$. Thus, $1, 2 \\notin B$.\n\nIf $A' \\cap B' = \\emptyset$, then $A \\cup B = E$. But when $n$ is odd $|A|, |B| \\le \\frac{n-1}{2}$ and hence $|A \\cup B| \\le n-1$. And when $n$ is even, the only possible case is $|A| = |B| = \\frac{n}{2}$, but then $B = A'$ and $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$.\n\nTherefore we conclude that $\\{1,2\\} \\subset B$ or $\\{1,2\\} \\cap B = \\emptyset$ for all $B$ in $M$ other than $\\{1\\}$ and $\\{2\\}$. Hence by removing $\\{1\\}$ and $\\{2\\}$ from $M$ and merging 1 and 2, we obtain a new maximal collection for $n-1$. By the induction hypothesis $k-2 \\le 2n-5$ and we also know that $k \\ge 2n-3$. Therefore $k = 2n-3$."

Then there is a unique line $\\ell$ such that $\\ell \\cap N$ is either (1) an edge $A'B'$ or (2) a vertex $C$ of $N$, and the closed half-planes determined by the lines $AB$ and $\\ell$ and containing $M$ and $N$, respectively, have nonempty intersection. Let $e(AB)$ denote the central median of the trapezoid $ABB'A'$ in Case 1 and the midline parallel to the side $AB$ of the triangle $ABC$ in Case 2. Let $h(AB)$ denote the closed half-plane defined by the line containing $e(AB)$ which has nonempty intersection with the half-planes mentioned above. The same notation will also be used when the roles of $M$ and $N$ are interchanged.\n\nLet $K_1$ be the intersection of the half-planes $h(AB)$ for all edges $AB$ of $M$ and $N$. $K_1$ is a convex polygon and its boundary is the union of the line segments $e(AB)$ for all edges $AB$ of $M$ and $N$. Since $h(AB)$ contains $K$ for all edges $AB$ of $M$ or $N$, $K_1$ contains $K$. In fact, $K_1 = K$: If $X$ is in $K_1$, then (by the Intermediate Value Theorem) $X$ is the midpoint of a line segment $YZ$ where $Y$ and $Z$ are on the edges of $K_1$. There exists $D$ and $E$ on the edges of $M$, and $D'$ and $E'$ on the edges of $N$ such that $Y$ and $Z$ are the midpoints of the line segments $DD'$ and $EE'$, respectively. Let $F$ be the midpoint of the line segment $DE$, and let $F'$ be the midpoints of the line segment $D'E'$. Then $F$ is in $M$, $F'$ is in $N$, and $X$ is the midpoint of $FF'$. This shows that $K_1 = K$.\n\nAn edge of $K$ will be called *t-type* in Case 1 and *M-type* in Case 2. *N-type* is defined similarly. Let $d_M$ and $d_N$ be the edge lengths of $M$ and $N$, respectively. Then *M-type*, *N-type* and *t-type* edges have lengths $d_M/2$, $d_N/2$ and $(d_M+d_N)/2$, respectively.\n\nAssume that $K$ is a regular polygon. Since $K$ is equilateral, it cannot have $M$-type and $t$-type edges or $N$-type and $t$-type edges at the same time. If all edges are $t$-type, then edges of $M$ and $N$ are parallel in pairs, and since $M$ and $N$ are regular polygons, this means that they are homothetic. In this case the reverse implication is obvious.\n\nNow we will consider the remaining case when $K$ is regular: $K$ has both $M$-type edges and $N$-type edges, but no $t$-type edge. Then $d_M = d_N$. Choose adjacent edges of different types: Let $AB$ be an $M$-type edge of $K$ and let $BC$ be an $N$-type edge of $K$. Then $AB = e(A_1B_1)$ is the midline of the triangle $A_1B_1B_2$, and $BC = e(B_2C_2)$ is the midline of the triangle $B_2C_2B_1$ where $A_1B_1$ is an edge of $M$ and $B_2C_2$ is an edge of $N$. Let $B_1C_1$ be the other edge of $M$ at vertex $B_1$, and let $A_2B_2$ be the other edge of $N$ at vertex $B_2$.\n\nSince $AB//A_1B_1$ and $BC//B_2C_2$, the angle $ABC$ is greater than both the angle $A_1B_1C_1$ and the angle $A_2B_2C_2$. On the other hand, the angle between two adjacent $M$-type edges of $K$ is equal to an interior angle of $M$, and the angle between two adjacent $N$-type edges is equal to an interior angle of $N$. Since $K$ is regular, we conclude that $K$ cannot have adjacent edges of the same type. Hence $M$-type and $N$-type edges must alternate and are equal in number. As the $M$-type edges are in bijection with the edges of $M$, and the $N$-type edges with the edges of $N$, $N$ is also an $m$-gon and $K$ is an equilateral $2m$-gon.\n\nLet $\\theta$ be the acute angle between the lines $B_1C_1$ and $B_2C_2$. Then we have the equality $\\angle ABC = \\angle A_1B_1C_1 + \\theta$. This means $180^{\\circ} \\cdot (2m-2)/(2m) = 180^{\\circ} \\cdot (m-2)/m + \\theta$. That is, $\\theta = 180^{\\circ}/m$. This completes the proof of the remaining case. In this case the reverse implication follows immediately from the same equality and the relation among the side\nlengths.",

Let $X = 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$. If $n \\nmid X$, then replace $x_1$ by $-x_1$. As $n \\nmid x_1$ and $n$ is odd, $n \\nmid 4x_1$ and hence we may assume that $n \\nmid X$. Then by the following identity\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (nx_i)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X - nx_i)^2\n$$\n\nletting $y_i = X - nx_i$ for all $1 \\le i \\le n$ works.\n\nFor a positive odd integer $n$, if a positive integer $a$ is sum of squares of $n$ integers with each of them is divisible by $n$, then there exist integers $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$ and a positive integer $r$ such that $a = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (n^r x_i)^2$ and $n \\nmid x_i$ for some $1 \\le i \\le n$.

Let $a$ be positive integer which is sum of squares of $8$ integers with each of them is divisible by $8$. Then $64|a$, hence $a \\ge 64$ and $a = 1^2 + 4^2 + 4^2 + 4^2 + x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2$ for some integers $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$ by Lagrange's four-square theorem.

If $d_1 > 1$ then let $p$ be a prime divisor of $d_1$. Since $d_2^2 = d_1^2 + d_1d_3$ we get that $p$ also divides $d_2$ and using the equations $d_k^2 = d_1^2 + d_{k-1}d_{k+1}$ we can inductively prove that $p$ divides all $d_i$'s which is a contradiction. Hence $d_1 = 1$ but in this case $A_1A_2 = A_2A_3 = 1$ and hence by triangle inequality, $d_2 = A_1A_3 < 1 + 1 = 2$ and hence $d_2 = 1$.

For $n = 4$, choose a rectangle with side lengths 3 and 4. For $n = 6$ choose a cyclic hexagon with consecutive side lengths 3, 5, 3, 5, 3, 5.

Since $b = a$, there must be another point $P_k$ such that $P_iP_k = b = a$. We claim that $k = i + 1$. If not, consider the cyclic quadrilateral $P_{i-1}P_iP_{i+1}P_k$. Since $90^\\circ > 90^\\circ - \\angle P_{i-1}P_iP_k/2 = \\angle P_iP_{i-1}P_k = 180^\\circ - \\angle P_iP_{i+1}P_k$, we get that $\\angle P_iP_{i+1}P_k > 90^\\circ$ and hence $a = P_iP_k > P_iP_{i+1}$ which contradicts to the choice of $a$. Hence $k = i + 1$ and since this result is true for all $i$, we conclude that the $P_iP_{i+1} = a$ for all $i = 1, 2, \\dots, n$ so these $n$ points form a regular $n$-gon.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Turska_2014_p5_data_16eed303f3.png)\n\nIf $a < b$, then exactly one of $P_{i-1}P_i$ and $P_iP_{i+1}$ is equal to $a$ and hence $n$ must be even and exactly $n/2$ of the sides of the $n$-gon $P_1P_2\\dots P_n$ must be equal to $a$ and none of these sides are consecutive. We claim that all other $n/2$ sides must be equal to $b$. Consider the four consecutive points $P_{i-1}P_iP_{i+1}P_{i+2}$ such that $P_iP_{i+1} = a$. By Lemma 1 $\\min\\{P_{i-1}P_{i+1}, P_{i+1}P_{i+2}\\} = b$ and similarly $\\min\\{P_{i-1}P_i, P_iP_{i+2}\\} = b$. If $P_iP_{i-1} = P_{i-1}P_{i+1} = b$ or $P_iP_{i+2} = P_{i+2}P_{i+1} = b$ then we would obtain that $b < a$ which is a contradiction. Hence either $P_iP_{i-1} = P_{i+1}P_{i+2} = b$ or $P_iP_{i+2} = P_{i-1}P_{i+1} = b$ which shows that the quadrilateral $P_{i-1}P_iP_{i+1}P_{i+2}$ is a isosceles trapezoid and hence $P_{i-1}P_i = P_{i+1}P_{i+2}$. Thus, all other $n/2$ sides are equal to $b$.\n\n**Lemma 2.** In a regular $n$-gon $A_1A_2\\dots A_n$ with $n \\ge 4$, there exists two points $A_i, A_j$ such that the distance between them is not an integer.\n\n**Proof:** In order to prove this lemma, consider a regular $n$-gon $A_1A_2\\dots A_n$ such that all pairs of distances between the vertices are integers.

If $q=3$ we get $p^4+2p = 23$ gives no solution. Therefore, $r$ is odd and the right hand side of the main equation is even. Then since $2p+q^4+q^2 = 2p+q^2(q^2+1)$ is even we get that $p^4$, equivalently $p$ is even: $p=2$. Thus, the main equation becomes $r^2 = q^4+q^2-4q^3+19$.

If different choices $C_1$ and $C_2$ produce the same distribution then these choices should not coincide on any two consecutive boxes.

If in choice C box m is chosen we write $C(m) = X$, otherwise we write $C(m) = Y$. Thus, for two consecutive boxes m, m + 1 there are four possibilities XX, XY, YX, YY. Note that if $C_1(m) = X$, $C_1(m+1) = X$ and $C_2(m) = Y$, $C_2(m+1) = Y$ then $C_1$ and $C_2$ can not produce the same distribution, since box m will contain different number of balls for $C_1$ and $C_2$. for these two choices.

However, the numbers of the form $r_j r_{k+1-j}$ can attain at most $\\lfloor \\frac{k+1}{2} \\rfloor$ distinct values and hence we get $k \\le \\lfloor \\frac{k+1}{2} \\rfloor$ which implies $k \\le 1$.

If the total number of moves is $2^{29}-1$ then all non-empty subsets of 29 element set should be selected. The total number of subsets containing given element $2^{28}$ is an even number. Therefore, at the end of all moves all balls should be in the box which was full at the beginning. On the other hand, since $2^{29}-1$ is odd, a box which was empty at the beginning should contain at least one ball, a contradiction.\n\nSuppose that at the beginning box A contains $n$ balls $\\{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n\\}$ and box B is empty. We show that the total number of moves can be equal to $2^{29}-2$.\n\n\\textbf{Solution 1:} Let us prove the following lemma.\n\n\\textit{Lemma:} Let $n > 2$. It is possible to make all moves containing fixed ball *a* and after these $2^{n-1}$ moves return to the initial position with empty *B*.\n\n\\textit{Proof:} We will use induction over $n$. If $n=3$ it can be done by applying moves $\\{a_1, a_2\\}$, $\\{a_1\\}$, $\\{a_1, a_3\\}$, $\\{a_1, a_2, a_3\\}$.\n\nNow suppose that for $n=k$ the inductive hypothesis is correct. Let us fix balls $a$ and $b$. By inductive hypothesis by applying all $2^{n-2}$ moves containing $a$ and not containing $b$ it is possible to return to the initial position. After that again by inductive hypothesis by applying all $2^{n-2}$ moves containing both $a$ and $b$ it is possible to return to the initial position. Thus, by applying all $2^{n-1}$ moves containing $a$ we return to the initial position. The lemma is proved.\n\nBy the lemma, we can make all moves containing ball $a_1$ and return to the initial position, after that make all moves not containing $a_1$ but containing $a_2$ and return to the initial position, after that make all moves not containing $a_1, a_2$ but containing $a_3$ and return to the initial position, ..., and make all moves not containing $a_1, a_2, ..., a_{26}$ but containing $a_{27}$ and return to the initial position. Finally, by making two moves with ball groups $\\{a_{28}, a_{29}\\}$ and $\\{a_{28}\\}$ we will make all possible move except a move $\\{a_{29}\\}$.

Since all roots of $P(x)$ are real numbers, all roots of the polynomial $Q(x) = (x-1)P(x) = x^{d+1} - 1 + ax^{b+1} - ax^b$ should be real numbers, too. If zero is a root of $Q(x)$, then we get $a = -1, b = 0$ and in this case all roots of $Q(x) = x^{d+1} - x$ cannot be real. So, all roots of $Q(x)$ should be non-zero.\n\nThe polynomial $Q(x)$ has at most 4 non-zero coefficients. By Descartes' rule of signs, $Q$ has at most 3 positive real roots. $Q(-x) = (-1)^{d+1}x^{d+1} - 1 + a(-1)^{b+1}(x^{b+1} + x^b)$ has also at most 4 non-zero coefficients.

Since $I\\!S'K'_A L'_A$ is a cyclic quadrilateral, we find $\\overline{P\\!L'_A S} = \\overline{I\\!L'_A S} = \\overline{I\\!K'_A S}$. Therefore, if we prove that $\\overline{I\\!K'_A S} = \\overline{K'_A H_B I}$, we get $\\overline{P\\!H_B S} = \\overline{P\\!H_B I} = \\overline{P\\!L'_A S}$, which means $L'_A P\\!S\\!H_B$ is cyclic and $\\overline{H_B P\\!L'_A} = \\overline{H_S L'_A} = 90^\\circ$. As a result, it suffices to show that $\\overline{I\\!K'_A S} = \\overline{K'_A H_B I}$, which is equivalent to $|IS||IH_B| = |I\\!K'_A|^2 = r^2$ where $r$ is the inradius of the triangle ABC. Since $\\overline{A\\!I\\!C} = 90^\\circ + \\frac{\\hat{B}}{2}$, the Sine theorem gives $\\frac{|IH_B|}{|AC|} = \\tan \\frac{\\hat{B}}{2} = \\frac{r}{u - |AC|}$. On the other hand, we have $|IS| = \\frac{h_B}{2} - r = \\frac{ur}{|AC|} - r$ because $L'_A S \\parallel AC$. Therefore, we get $|IS||IH_B| = \\frac{|AC|r}{u - |AC|} \\frac{r(u - |AC|)}{|AC|} = r^2$, so the result follows.\n\n**Second Way:** We claim $H_B H_C$ is the polar line of $L'_A$ with respect to the incircle, which completes the proof easily. Let $N$ be the point on $IC$ such that $BN \\perp IC$. Since $|BL'_A| = |CL'_A|$, we have $\\overline{NL'_A B} = 2 \\cdot \\overline{N\\overline{C}B} = \\hat{C}$.

Let $L'_A, K'_A \\in BC$ be points such that $|BL'_A| = |CL'_A|$ and $IK'_A \\perp BC$. Define $K'_B, L'_B, K'_C, L'_C$, similarly. Now we can complete the proof in two different ways:\n\n**First Way:** We claim that $H_B K'_A \\perp I\\!L'_A$. This completes the proof since it also means $H_C K'_A \\perp I\\!L'_A$ by symmetry, which implies $I\\!L'_A \\perp H_B H_C$ and $K'_A \\in H_B H_C$, so we can conclude that $L_A = L'_A$ and $K_A = K'_A$. Let $P$ be the point of intersection of $H_B K'_A$ and $I\\!L'_A$, and let $S$ be the point on $IH_B$ such that $S\\!L'_A \\perp I\\!H_B$. Since $I\\!S'K'_A L'_A$ is a cyclic quadrilateral, we find $\\overline{P\\!L'_A S} = \\overline{I\\!L'_A S} = \\overline{I\\!K'_A S}$. Therefore, if we prove that $\\overline{I\\!K'_A S} = \\overline{K'_A H_B I}$, we get $\\overline{P\\!H_B S} = \\overline{P\\!H_B I} = \\overline{P\\!L'_A S}$, which means $L'_A P\\!S\\!H_B$ is cyclic and $\\overline{H_B P\\!L'_A} = \\overline{H_S L'_A} = 90^\\circ$. As a result, it suffices to show that $\\overline{I\\!K'_A S} = \\overline{K'_A H_B I}$, which is equivalent to $|IS||IH_B| = |I\\!K'_A|^2 = r^2$ where $r$ is the inradius of the triangle ABC. Since $\\overline{A\\!I\\!C} = 90^\\circ + \\frac{\\hat{B}}{2}$, the Sine theorem gives $\\frac{|IH_B|}{|AC|} = \\tan \\frac{\\hat{B}}{2} = \\frac{r}{u - |AC|}$. On the other hand, we have $|IS| = \\frac{h_B}{2} - r = \\frac{ur}{|AC|} - r$ because $L'_A S \\parallel AC$. Therefore, we get $|IS||IH_B| = \\frac{|AC|r}{u - |AC|} \\frac{r(u - |AC|)}{|AC|} = r^2$, so the result follows.\n\n**Second Way:** We claim $H_B H_C$ is the polar line of $L'_A$ with respect to the incircle, which completes the proof easily. Let $N$ be the point on $IC$ such that $BN \\perp IC$. Since $|BL'_A| = |CL'_A|$, we have $\\overline{NL'_A B} = 2 \\cdot \\overline{N\\overline{C}B} = \\hat{C}$. This implies $NL'_A \\parallel AC$, in other words we get $N \\in L'_A L'_C$. On the other hand, we obtain\n\n$180^\\circ - \\overline{NK'_C I} = \\overline{NBI} = 90^\\circ - \\overline{IBC} - \\overline{ICB} = IK'_C K'_B$ since $N, K'_C, I, B$ are concyclic, so we obtain $N \\in K'_B K'_C$.\n\nNow, $N \\in K'_B K'_C$ means that $N$ lies on the polar line of $A$, so we can say that $A$ lies on the polar line of $N$. Since $AH_B \\perp IN$, we get $AH_B$ is the polar line of $N$, which implies $N$ lies on the polar line of $H_B$. On the other hand, we have $L'_A L'_C \\perp IH_B$ and $N \\in L'_A L'_C$, so we can conclude that $L'_A L'_C$ is the polar line of $H_B$. Similarly, we obtain $L'_A L'_B$ is the polar line of $H_C$, which implies that $H_B H_C$ is the polar line of $L'_A$, so the result follows.",

Then we can swap the $-$ sign appearing in the largest element in the set of stars $\\{0, 1, \\dots, k-3\\}$ with the positive signs in the stars numbered $k-1$ and $k-2$. If there are any $+$ signs among the two. If there are less than two signs on one of the ends, we just add new terms, and because the signs are different this will only decrease the value of the function. We perform the same operation for $k+1$ (carrying the $+$ signs to the closest two places), then we see that the new function on the blackboard takes values less than the original one for each value of $x$ in this interval. Moreover, new function is always positive for the values in this interval, since the 6 consecutive terms appearing in the lemma has positive sum and for all the other terms, just like the argument in the infinite interval claim, all positive terms can be paired up with a negative term having less absolute value (and same for the other part with opposite signs), hence the function is always positive in this interval and have no roots.\n\n\\dagger\\dagger\\ If the signs of $k, k+1$ are equal, there is exactly one real solution in the interval $(2^k, 2^{k+1})$. We will proceed with similar arguments, but in this case we will prove that the function of the blackboard is always increasing or decreasing. We consider the derivative for this case. We will start with the following lemma.\n\n\\textbf{Lemma 2:} For all $x \\in (2^k, 2^{k+1})$ we have\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{(x - 2^k)^2} - \\frac{1}{(x - 2^{k-1})^2} - \\frac{1}{(x - 2^{k-2})^2} \\geq 0\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{(x - 2^{k+1})^2} - \\frac{1}{(x - 2^{k+2})^2} - \\frac{1}{(x - 2^{k+3})^2} \\geq 0\n$$\n\n\\textit{Proof:} Again we will use the transformation $x = 2^{k-2}y$. Then, the first inequality becomes\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{(y-4)^2} \\geq \\frac{1}{(y-2)^2} + \\frac{1}{(y-1)^2}\n$$\n\nfor $y \\in (4, 8)$. We can even prove the stronger statement as $\\frac{1}{(y-4)^2} \\geq \\frac{2}{(y-2)^2}$ since the linear inequality $\\sqrt{2}(y-4) \\leq y-2$ is held in the interval $y \\in (4, 8)$.\n\nThe second inequality becomes\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{(y-8)^2} \\geq \\frac{1}{(y-16)^2} + \\frac{1}{(y-32)^2}\n$$\n\nLHS gets its minimum value at $y = 4$, RHS gets its maximum at $x = 8$ and when we compare these two values we still get that LHS is greater than the RHS.\n\nNow, when we take the derivative we will see that by the lemma above, the value of the derivative is always positive for these 6 consecutive terms and by the same swapping and pairing arguments used previously, the derivative of the function on the blackboard has a value greater than 0 hence the function is strictly increasing (or decreasing) in this interval, hence it must provide exactly 1 root.\n\nFinally, Zehra's strategy shows that there can be at most 1002 real solutions to the equation at the end. That's because there are no real solutions are coming from the infinite intervals, and 1001 among the 2023 finite intervals have opposite signs at its ends thus they provide no solutions as well. This lefts at most 1002 intervals with same signs at both ends where each such interval can provide at most one real solution, bounding the number of real solutions above by 1002. However, at the end, the numerator is a polynomial of degree 2023 since the number of signs are not equal and we will have either $2x^{2023}$ or $-2x^{2023}$ as the leading coefficient after expanding. Since the degree is odd, the number of real roots must\n\nbe odd, this forces the number of real solutions to be at most 1011 since 1012 real solutions is not possible and this completes the proof.",

      "statement_latex": "Let us describe the strategy of Aslı for guaranteeing at least 1011 solutions of the equation. Aslı makes her first move arbitrarily. After that, at each move she chooses any star with already replaced neighbour and replaces this star with the sign of this neighbour. She completes the game with 1011 such moves after her first one. With this strategy, Aslı guarantees the existence of at least 1011 intervals of the form $(2^k, 2^{k+1})$ such that the signs in front of both $\\frac{1}{x-2^k}$ and $\\frac{1}{x-2^{k+1}}$ are the same. In such an interval, by considering the values of $x$ arbitrarily close to $2^k$ and $2^{k+1}$, the equation on the board takes both arbitrarily large and arbitrarily small values. Therefore, by the Mean Value Theorem, there is a real root of this equation in this interval and hence Aslı guarantees at least 1011 solutions to this equation.\n\nNow we will describe Zehra's strategy to keep the number of real roots less than 1012. Let us enumerate the stars as 0, 1, 2, ..., 2023. Consider the pairs (0, 2023) and (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), ..., (2021, 2022). Zehra's strategy is the following: For the pair (0, 2023), whenever Aslı puts a sign in one of them, Zehra puts the same sign on the other one. For all the other pairs, whenever Aslı puts a sign in one of them, Zehra puts the opposite sign. We will show that this strategy works.\n\nFirstly we consider the infinite intervals. Without loss of generality, assume that signs of the pair (0, 2023) is +. Consider the values $x \\in (2^{2023}, \\infty)$. We will start reading all the signs from 2023 to 0. First, we will see a + sign in 2023, then for each consecutive terms we read a pair of opposite signs until the last one with a + sign. At any set in the range from $k$ to 2023 for $0 \\le k \\le 2023$, we will see more positive terms than negative ones. That's because if $k$ is odd, we have $\\frac{k-1}{2}$ pairs of opposite signs with a plus sign\nat the end, and if $k$ is even we have $\\frac{k-2}{2}$ pairs of opposite signs with a plus sign at the end again, making sure that number of plus signs is always at least half of all signs. So, we can assign to each minus sign a plus one appearing later in the equation. Since the terms appearing later has larger absolute value, in these pairings each pair has a positive sum with two positive numbers remaining in hand, which means the function is always positive and there are no real roots. Same argument applies for the other infinite interval.\n\nNow we consider the intervals between the stars numbered $(k, k+1)$ for $0 \\le k \\le 2022$. There are two possible cases based on their signs:\n\n\\dagger\\ If the signs of $k, k+1$ are different, there are no real solutions in the interval $(2^k, 2^{k+1})$. We will show that the equation is either always positive or always negative in this interval. We will start with the following observation.\n\n\\textbf{Lemma 1:} For all $x \\in (2^k, 2^{k+1})$ we have\n\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x-2^{k-2}} - \\frac{1}{x-2^{k-1}} + \\frac{1}{x-2^k} - \\frac{1}{x-2^{k+1}} + \\frac{1}{x-2^{k+2}} + \\frac{1}{x-2^{k+3}} \\ge 0\n$$\n\n\\textit{Proof:} Let $x = 2^{k-2}y$ then we need to show that for each $y \\in (4, 8)$ we have\n\n$$\n\\frac{4}{(y-4)(8-y)} \\ge \\frac{14}{(y-2)(16-y)} + \\frac{31}{(y-1)(32-y)}\n$$\n\nWe know that the product of two positive real numbers with a fixed sum is larger when the numbers are closer. Therefore, smallest value of LHS in this interval is 1 when $y = 3$, while the largest value of the RHS in this interval is $\\frac{14}{24} + \\frac{31}{84} < 1$ when $y = 4$, hence we are done."

We can even prove the stronger statement as $\\frac{1}{(y-4)^2} \\geq \\frac{2}{(y-2)^2}$ since the linear inequality $\\sqrt{2}(y-4) \\leq y-2$ is held in the interval $y \\in (4, 8)$.\n\nThe second inequality becomes\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{(y-8)^2} \\geq \\frac{1}{(y-16)^2} + \\frac{1}{(y-32)^2}\n$$\n\nLHS gets its minimum value at $y = 4$, RHS gets its maximum at $x = 8$ and when we compare these two values we still get that LHS is greater than the RHS.\n\nNow, when we take the derivative we will see that by the lemma above, the value of the derivative is always positive for these 6 consecutive terms and by the same swapping and pairing arguments used previously, the derivative of the function on the blackboard has a value greater than 0 hence the function is strictly increasing (or decreasing) in this interval, hence it must provide exactly 1 root.\n\nFinally, Zehra's strategy shows that there can be at most 1002 real solutions to the equation at the end. That's because there are no real solutions are coming from the infinite intervals, and 1001 among the 2023 finite intervals have opposite signs at its ends thus they provide no solutions as well. This lefts at most 1002 intervals with same signs at both ends where each such interval can provide at most one real solution, bounding the number of real solutions above by 1002. However, at the end, the numerator is a polynomial of degree 2023 since the number of signs are not equal and we will have either $2x^{2023}$ or $-2x^{2023}$ as the leading coefficient after expanding. Since the degree is odd, the number of real roots must be odd, this forces the number of real solutions to be at most 1011 since 1012 real solutions is not possible and this completes the proof.",

If there are any $+$ signs among the two. If there are less than two signs on one of the ends, we just add new terms, and because the signs are different this will only decrease the value of the function. We perform the same operation for $k+1$ (carrying the $+$ signs to the closest two places), then we see that the new function on the blackboard takes values less than the original one for each value of $x$ in this interval. Moreover, new function is always positive for the values in this interval, since the 6 consecutive terms appearing in the lemma has positive sum and for all the other terms, just like the argument in the infinite interval claim, all positive terms can be paired up with a negative term having less absolute value (and same for the other part with opposite signs), hence the function is always positive in this interval and have no roots.\n\n\\dagger\\dagger\\ If the signs of $k, k+1$ are equal, there is exactly one real solution in the interval $(2^k, 2^{k+1})$.

Let $P_1$ and $P_2$ be numbers constituted by the first $k$ digits of $D_1$ and $D_2$, respectively. If the set of digits of $P_1$ and the set of digits of $P_2$ coincide then $P_1 = P_2$.\n\n*Proof:* Assume the contrary: suppose that the set of digits $P_1$ and $P_2$ coincide but $P_1 \\neq P_2$. Among $k$ digits, let $l$ be the very first digit from the left when corresponding digits of $P_1$ and $P_2$ are different. Since $P_1$ and $P_2$ are consecutive, $l$-th digits of $P_1$ and $P_2$ should be $j$ and $j+1$, respectively. By definition, $1 \\le l \\le k-1$. Since $D_1$ and $D_2$ are consecutive, by erasing of first $l$ digits of $D_1$ we should get a maximal possible number and by erasing of first $l$ digits of $D_2$ we should get a minimal possible number. Let $p$ be the last digit of $D_1$. Then in $D_2$, $p$ should be just after $j+1$. This contradicts with the fact that the set of digits of $P_1$ and $P_2$ coincide. Thus, $P_1 = P_2$. $\\square$\n\nSuppose that there are two differently located coinciding 17-blocks, say $a$ and $b$. Any 17-block totally contains some balanced integer, otherwise it is length is at most $8+8=16$. Let $K_1$ and $K_2$ be balanced integers contained in this two 17-blocks, respectively. Since 17-blocks are differently located, $K_1 \\neq K_2$. Moreover, $K_1$ and $K_2$ should share some digits, otherwise the block would consists at least $9+9=18$ digits. Let the common part of $K_1$ and $K_2$ be $u_2$. Let $alb$ be the concatenation of $a$ and $b$. Without loss of generality, let us represent $K_1$ and $K_2$ by the following concatenations: $K_1 = u_1|u_2$ and $K_2 = u_2|u_3$. Thus, the sequence $u_1|u_2|u_3$ is a subsequence of both $a$ and $b$. Moreover, since both $u_1$ and $u_3$ contain digits not represented in $u_2$, $u_1$ and $u_2$ have the same length and same set of digits.\n\n$K_1 = u_1|u_2$ is a balanced integer starts with $u_1$.

Let the circumcircle of the triangle ABC be $\\Gamma$ and let the circumcircle of the triangle AEF be $\\omega$. Let AD meet $\\Gamma$ for the second time at the $Q$ and let $AS \\cap BC = P$. Let the intersection of $\\Gamma$ and $\\omega$ other than A be M. The radical axis of the circles $\\Gamma$, $\\omega$ and (BCEF) are concurrent, let this point be $AM \\cap EF \\cap BC = L$. Let the line passing through A and parallel to BC intersect $\\Gamma$ for the second time at A'. Since $\\angle C = \\angle AFE = \\angle EAA'$ we find that $AA'$ and $\\omega$ are tangent to each other.\n\nLet us consider the spiral similarity $\\sigma$ centred at M and satisfying $F \\to B, E \\to C$. It is in fact the spiral similarity that sends the circle $\\omega$ to the circle $\\Gamma$, thus $\\sigma$ also satisfies $S \\to A, A \\to A'$ and $R \\to Q$. Since $AQ$ is a symmedian, the tangent lines to $\\Gamma$ passing through $Q$ and A intersect on the line BC. Therefore, under $\\sigma$, the tangent lines to $\\omega$ passing through R and S intersect on the line EF. In addition, simple angle chasing gives that $\\angle BDF = \\angle C$ and $\\angle AEF = \\angle B, \\angle DEC = \\angle A$ which means $\\angle FED = \\angle C$ hence, circumcircle of the triangle DEF and the line BC are tangent to each other. From here we find $LD^2 = LE \\cdot LF = LB \\cdot LC$, also since we know $(P,D;B,C) = -1$ we obtain that $L$ is the midpoint of the segment PD. We found that the lines $AA'$ and BC are parallel, therefore we have $(AP;AD;AL, AA') = -1$ and projecting these lines to $\\omega$ we find that $(S,R;M,A) = -1$, which means the tangent lines to $\\omega$ passing through S, R intersect on the line AM. In this case, this intersection point was also on the line EF, it must be $L$.\n\nSo, we find that the polar line of $L$ with respect to $\\omega$ is SR, and since $AM \\cap EF = L$, from Brokard's Theorem in quadrilateral AMEF, the lines AF and EM intersects on the polar line SR. Hence AB, EM, SR are concurrent, and we also have $(T,L;F,E) = -1$. Furthermore, on the circle $\\omega$ we have $(S,Q;A,M) = -1$ and under $\\sigma$ its image is $(A,Q;M,A') = 1$, hence the points $A', M, P$ are collinear. Let $A'M \\cap AQ = V$, then we obtain $(P,V;M,A') = -1$. Finally, by definition we have $AA' \\parallel BC$ and under $\\sigma$ it becomes\n\nSA $\\parallel$ EF. Projecting (S, R; M, A) = -1 over S to w and reflecting to the line EF to obtain (SS, SR; SM, SA) = (T, L; W, $\\infty_{EF}$) = -1 where W = SM $\\cap$ EF. So, W is the midpoint of TL.\n\nNow, we will work on the problem statement to finish the solution. We will prove that both conditions are equivalent to $\\angle B = 2\\angle C$ or $180^\\circ + \\angle B = 2\\angle C$. Solution to both cases are identical, thus we only study the case where $\\angle B > \\angle C$. First, we know that $\\angle MA' = \\angle B - \\angle C$ and under $\\sigma$ we have $\\angle SMA = \\angle B - \\angle C$. Also, we have $\\angle AME = \\angle AFE = \\angle C$. $\\angle B = 2\\angle C$ is equivalent to the following statements:\n\n$$\n(1) \\angle B = 2\\angle C \\Leftrightarrow \\angle SMA + \\angle AMB = \\angle B - \\angle C + (180^\\circ - \\angle C) = 180^\\circ \\Leftrightarrow B, M, W, S \\text{ are collinear.}\n$$\n\n$$\n(2) \\angle B = 2\\angle C \\Leftrightarrow \\angle MA' = \\angle B - \\angle C = \\angle C = \\angle AME \\Leftrightarrow P, M, E, A' \\text{ are collinear.}\n$$\n\nFrom the first condition, BS bisecting [TL] is equivalent to $\\angle B = 2\\angle C$. From the concurrency $AB, SR, EM$ we find that $SR$ bisecting $[AB]$ is equivalent to $EM$ bisecting $[AB]$. $EM$ bisecting $[AB]$ is equivalent to the condition $(EA, EB; EM, ED) = -1$, and reflecting these lines to the line $BC$ shows that it is in fact equivalent to $E, M, P$ being collinear. From the second condition this is equivalent to $\\angle B = 2\\angle C$ hence the required statement is proven.",

Let BE, CF be the altitudes of the triangle and $A_b A_c \\cap BC = T$. Let the second intersection of the line $HM_a$ with the circle (AFHE) be $R$ and the foot of the perpendicular from $H$ to the line $AX$ be $S$. Since the points $O_a, O_b, O_c$ lie on the altitudes of the triangle ABC, we have $(O_b, O_c; M_a, \\infty) = -1$ and projecting this to the circle (AFHE) from the point $H$ we obtain $(E, F; R, S) = -1$. Then projecting this from $A$ to the line BC we have $(C, B; A R \\cap BC, A X \\cap BC) = -1$ hence we must have $AR \\cap BC = T$. Since $R$ lies on the circle with diameter $AH$ we obtain $HM_a \\perp AT$.

Then we obtain $DA_3 \\cdot DO = DO^2 - OA_3 \\cdot DO = DO^2 - R^2 = DB \\cdot DC$ hence $B, C, O, A_3$ are concyclic and $\\angle BA_3C = 2 \\angle BAC$.

Let $AS \\cap IO = K$. We have $\\frac{AA'}{A_3S} = 2\\frac{AA'/2}{A_3S} = 2\\frac{AK}{KS}$.
