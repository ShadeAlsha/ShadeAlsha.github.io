          "latex": "(a) A *diagonal* square in an $n$-staircase is a unit square that lies on the diagonal going from the top-left to the bottom-right. A *minimal tiling* of an $n$-staircase is a tiling consisting of $f(n)$ square tiles.\n\nObserve that $f(n) \\ge n$ for all $n$. There are $n$ diagonal squares in an $n$-staircase, and a square tile can cover at most one diagonal square, so any tiling requires at least $n$ square tiles. In other words, $f(n) \\ge n$. Hence, if $f(n) = n$, then each square tile covers exactly one diagonal square.\n\nLet $n$ be a positive integer such that $f(n) = n$, and consider a minimal tiling of an $n$-staircase. The only square tile that can cover the unit square in the first row is the unit square itself.\n\nNow consider the left-most unit square in the second row. The only square tile that can cover this unit square and a diagonal square is a $2 \\times 2$ square tile.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Kanada_2010_p2_data_669a042cf2.png)\n\nNext, consider the left-most unit square in the fourth row. The only square tile that can cover this unit square and a diagonal square is a $4 \\times 4$ square tile.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Kanada_2010_p3_data_3f32d0db15.png)\n\nContinuing this construction, we see that the side lengths of the square tiles we encounter will be 1, 2, 4, and so on, up to $2^k$ for some nonnegative integer $k$. Therefore, $n$, the height of the $n$-staircase, is equal to $1+2+4+\\cdots+2^k = 2^{k+1}-1$. Alternatively, $n = 2^k - 1$ for some positive integer $k$. Let $p(k) = 2^k - 1$.\n\nConversely, we can tile a $p(k)$-staircase with $p(k)$ square tiles recursively as follows: We have that $p(1) = 1$, and we can tile a 1-staircase with 1 square tile. Assume that we can tile a $p(k)$-staircase with $p(k)$ square tiles for some positive integer $k$.\n\nConsider a $p(k+1)$-staircase. Place a $2^k \\times 2^k$ square tile in the bottom left corner. Note that this square tile covers a diagonal square. Then $p(k+1) - 2^k = 2^{k+1} - 1 - 2^k = 2^k - 1 = p(k)$, so we are left with two $p(k)$-staircases.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Kanada_2010_p3_data_26651aab5a.png)\n\nFurthermore, these two $p(k)$-staircases can be tiled with $2p(k)$ square tiles, which means we use $2p(k) + 1 = p(k + 1)$ square tiles.\n\nTherefore, $f(n) = n$ if and only if $n = 2^k - 1 = p(k)$ for some positive integer $k$. In other words, the binary representation of $n$ consists of all 1s, with no 0s.\n\n(b) Let $n$ be a positive integer such that $f(n) = n + 1$, and consider a minimal tiling of an $n$-staircase. Since there are $n$ diagonal squares, every square tile except one covers a diagonal square. We claim that the square tile that covers the bottom-left unit square must be the square tile that does not cover a diagonal square.\n\nIf $n$ is even, then this fact is obvious, because the square tile that covers the bottom-left unit square cannot cover any diagonal square, so assume that $n$ is odd. Let $n = 2m + 1$. We may assume that $n > 1$, so $m \\ge 1$. Suppose that the square tile covering the bottom-left unit square also covers a diagonal square. Then the side length of this square tile must be $m + 1$. After this $(m+1) \\times (m+1)$ square tile has been placed, we are left with two $m$-staircases.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Kanada_2010_p4_data_ec97d01873.png)\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Kanada_2010_p4_data_1566e643bf.png)\n\nHence, $f(n) = 2f(m) + 1$. But $2f(m) + 1$ is odd, and $n + 1 = 2m + 2$ is even, so $f(n)$ cannot be equal to $n + 1$, contradiction. Therefore, the square tile that covers the bottom-left unit square is the square tile that does not cover a diagonal square.\n\nLet $t$ be the side length of the square tile covering the bottom-left unit square. Then every other square tile must cover a diagonal square, so by the same construction as in part (a), $n = 1+2+4+\\cdots+2^{k-1}+t = 2^k+t-1$ for some positive integer $k$. Furthermore, the top $p(k) = 2^k-1$ rows of the $n$-staircase must be tiled the same way as the minimal tiling of a $p(k)$-staircase. Therefore, the horizontal line between rows $p(k)$ and $p(k)+1$ does not pass through any square tiles. Let us call such a line a *fault line*. Similarly, the vertical line between columns $t$ and $t+1$ is also a fault line. These two fault lines partition two $p(k)$-staircases.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Kanada_2010_p4_data_37ed5d5b91.png)\n\nIf these two $p(k)$-staircases do not overlap, then $t = p(k)$, so $n = 2p(k)$. For example, the minimal tiling for $n = 2p(2) = 6$ is shown below.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Kanada_2010_p4_data_70e0e47f6f.png)\n\nHence, assume that the two $p(k)$-staircases do overlap. The intersection of the two $p(k)$-staircases is a $[p(k) - t]$-staircase. Since this $[p(k) - t]$-staircase is tiled the same way as the top $p(k) - t$ rows of a minimal tiling of a $p(k)$-staircase, $p(k) - t = p(l)$ for some positive integer $l < k$, so $t = p(k) - p(l)$. Then\n\n\\[\nn = t + p(k) = 2p(k) - p(l).\n\\]\n\nSince $p(0) = 0$, we can summarize by saying that $n$ must be of the form\n\n\\[\nn = 2p(k) - p(l) = 2^{k+1} - 2^l - 1,\n\\]",

Removing a vertex $P_i$ from $X$ (along with all edges connecting to $P_i$) and applying the induction assumption to the resulting smaller graph, we see that there exists a sequence of operations $g_i$ (obtained by composing some $f_j$, with $j \\ne i$) which changes the colour of every vertex in $X$, except for possibly $P_i$.\n\nIf $g_i$ it also changes the color of $P_i$ then we are done.

In particular, the vector $v$ connecting $A$ to $B$ on the grid must have never changed. We moved $A$ to the position $B = A + v$, and therefore we must have also moved $B$ to $B + v$.

Since $(x+1)P(x-1) - (x-1)P(x)$ is a constant polynomial, $2P(-1) = 2P(0)$. Hence, $P(-1) = P(0)$.\n\nLet $c = P(-1) = P(0)$ and $Q(x) = P(x) - c$. Then $Q(-1) = Q(0) = 0$. Hence, $0, -1$ are roots of $Q(x)$. Consequently, $Q(x) = x(x+1)R(x)$ for some polynomial $R$.

Therefore, $R(x-1)-R(x) = 0$ as a polynomial. Therefore, $R(x) = R(x-1)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Then $R(x)$ is a polynomial that takes on certain values for infinitely many values of $x$. Let $k$ be such a value. Then $R(x) - k$ has infinitely many roots, which can occur if and only if $R(x) - k = 0$. Therefore, $R(x)$ is identical to a constant $k$. Hence, $Q(x) = kx(x+1)$ for some constant $k$. Therefore, $P(x) = kx(x+1)+c = kx^2+kx+c$.\n\nFinally, we verify that all such $P(x) = kx(x+1)+c$ work.

Hence, $0, -1$ are roots of $Q(x)$. Consequently, $Q(x) = x(x+1)R(x)$ for some polynomial $R$.

Therefore, the task is impossible.\n\nNow suppose $n$ is odd. We will show that we can construct $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ that satisfy the conditions given in the problem. Then let $n = 2k + 1$ for some non-negative integer $k$.

We will consider the cases when $m$ is odd and when $m$ is even separately. Let $b_m = a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_m$.\n\nIf $m$ is odd, note that $a_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2k+2}$, $a_2 + a_3 = a_4 + a_5 = \\dots = a_{2k} + a_{2k+1} = 2k+3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2k+2}$.

We begin by drawing an $n \\times n$ board, with corners at $(0,0)$, $(n,0)$, $(0,n)$ and $(n,n)$ on the Cartesian plane.\n\nConsider the line $\\ell$ with slope $r$ passing through $(0,0)$. For each $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, consider the point $(j, \\min(jr, n))$. Note that each such point either lies on $\\ell$ or the top edge of the board. In the $j^{th}$ column from the left, draw the rectangle of height $\\min(jr, n)$. Note that the sum of the $n$ rectangles is equal to the area of the board under the line $\\ell$ plus $n$ triangles (possibly with area 0) each with width at most 1 and whose sum of the heights is at most $n$. Therefore, the sum of the areas of these $n$ triangles is at most $n/2$. Therefore, $\\sum_{j=1}^n \\min(jr, n)$ is at most the area of the square under $\\ell$ plus $n/2$.\n\nConsider the line with slope $1/r$. By symmetry about the line $y=x$, the area of the square under the line with slope $1/r$ is equal to the area of the square above the line $\\ell$. Therefore, using the same reasoning as before, $\\sum_{j=1}^n \\min(j/r, n)$ is at most the area of the square above $\\ell$ plus $n/2$.\n\nTherefore, $\\sum_{j=1}^n f_j(r) = \\sum_{j=1}^n (\\min(jr, n) + \\min(\\frac{j}{r}, n))$ is at most the area of the board plus $n$, which is $n^2+n$. This proves the left hand side inequality.\n\nTo prove the right hand side inequality, we will use the following lemma:\n\n**Lemma:** Consider the line $\\ell$ with slope $s$ passing through $(0,0)$. Then the number of squares on the board that contain an interior point below $\\ell$ is $\\sum_{j=1}^n \\min(\\lceil js \\rceil, n)$.\n\n*Proof of Lemma:* For each $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, we count the number of squares in the $j^{th}$ column (from the left) that contain an interior point lying below the line $\\ell$. The line $x=j$ intersect the line $\\ell$ at $(j, js)$. Hence, since each column contains $n$ squares total, the number of such squares is $\\min(\\lfloor js \\rfloor, n)$. Summing over all $j \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$ proves the lemma. *End Proof of Lemma*\n\nBy the lemma, the rightmost expression of the inequality is equal to the number of squares containing an interior point below the line with slope $r$ plus the number of squares containing an interior point below the line with slope $1/r$. By symmetry about the line $y = x$, the latter number is equal to the number of squares containing an interior point above the line with slope $r$. Therefore, the rightmost expression of the inequality is equal to the number of squares of the board plus the number of squares of which $\\ell$ passes through the interior. The former is equal to $n^2$. Hence, to prove the inequality, it suffices to show that every line passes through the interior of at least $n$ squares. Since $\\ell$ has positive slope, each $\\ell$ passes through either $n$ rows and/or $n$ columns. In either case, $\\ell$ passes through the interior of at least $n$ squares. Hence, the right inequality holds. $\\square$",

The first number must have value between 0 and $k-1$, and if we do not stop immediately, then there are at least $k-1$ non-zero numbers, and hence the third step can be performed.\n\nFor each $j$ with $1 \\le j \\le k-2$, we claim the first number can take on the value of $j$ at most a finite number of times without taking on the value of $j-1$ in between. If this were to fail, then every time the first number became $j$, I would have to add 1 to the selected numbers to avoid making it $j-1$. This will always increase the $j$-th last non-zero number, and that number will never be changed by other steps. Therefore, that number would eventually become 0, and the next last non-zero number would eventually become zero, and so on, until the first number itself becomes the $j$-th last non-zero number, at which point we are done since $j \\le k-2$.\n\nRephrasing slightly, if $1 \\le j \\le k-2$, the first number can take on the value of $j$ at most a finite number of times between each time it takes on the value of $j-1$. It then immediately follows that if the first number can take on the value of $j-1$ at most a finite number of times, then it can also only take on the value of $j$ a finite number of times. However, if it ever takes on the value of 0, we have already reduced the problem to $n-1$, so we can assume that never happens. It then follows that the first number can take on all the values $0, 1, 2, \\dots, k-2$ at most a finite number of times.\n\nFinally, every time the first number takes on the value of $k-1$, it must subsequently take on the value of $k-2$ or 0, and so that can also happen only finitely many times.",

Otherwise, we may assume without loss of generality that $b \\neq \\pm a \\pmod{p} \\implies ba^{-1} \\neq \\pm 1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nNow let $q = \\frac{p-1}{2}$. By Fermat's little theorem, we know that the order of $ba^{-1}$ mod $p$ divides $p-1 = 2q$. However, since $ba^{-1} \\neq \\pm 1 \\pmod{p}$, the order of $ba^{-1}$ does not divide 2. Thus, the order must be either $q$ or $2q$.\n\nNext, let $S$ denote the set of positive integers $n < p$ such that $a^n + b^n + c^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$, and let $s_t$ denote the number of ordered pairs $(i, j) \\subset S$ such that $i - j \\equiv t \\pmod{p-1}$.\n\n**Lemma:** If $t$ is a positive integer less than $2q$ and not equal to $q$, then $s_t \\le 2$.\n\n**Proof:** Consider $i, j \\in S$ with $j - i \\equiv t \\pmod{p-1}$.

However, we know the order of $ab^{-1}$ is $q$ or $2q$, and $q \\nmid t$, so this impossible. Thus, we can write\n\n$$\n(ab^{-1})^i \\equiv (b^t - c^t) \\cdot (c^t - a^t)^{-1} \\pmod{p}.\n$$\n\nFor a fixed $t$, the right-hand side of this equation is fixed, so $(ab^{-1})^i$ is also fixed. Since the order of $ab^{-1}$ is either $q$ or $2q$, it follows that there are at most 2 solutions for $i$, and the lemma is proven. □\n\nNow, for each element $i$ in $S$, there are at least $|S| - 2$ other elements that differ from $i$ by a quantity other than $q \\pmod{p-1}$.

By the Power-of-a-Point Theorem, $AH \\cdot AD = AF \\cdot AB$. (We can derive this result in other ways: for example, see Method 2, below.)\n\nSince $AF = AC \\cdot \\cos \\angle A$, we have $AH \\cdot AD = AC \\cdot AB \\cdot \\cos \\angle A = bc \\cos \\angle A$.\n\nBy the Cosine Law, $\\cos \\angle A = \\frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc}$, which implies that $AH \\cdot AD = \\frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2}$.\n\nBy symmetry, we can show that $BH \\cdot BE = \\frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2}$ and $CH \\cdot CF = \\frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2}$.\n\nHence,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nAH \\cdot AD + BH \\cdot BE + CH \\cdot CF &= \\frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2} + \\frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2} + \\frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2} \\\\\n&= \\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{2}. \\qquad (1)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nOur desired inequality, $\\frac{AB \\cdot AC + BC \\cdot BA + CA \\cdot CB}{AH \\cdot AD + BH \\cdot BE + CH \\cdot CF} \\le 2$, is equivalent to the inequality $\\frac{cb + ac + ba}{\\frac{a^2+b^2+c^2}{2}} \\le 2$, which simplifies to $2a^2 + 2b^2 + 2c^2 \\ge 2ab + 2bc + 2ca$.\n\nBut this last inequality is easy to prove, as it is equivalent to $(a-b)^2+(a-c)^2+(b-c)^2 \\ge 0$.\n\nTherefore, we have established the desired inequality. The proof also shows that equality occurs if and only if $a = b = c$, i.e., $\\triangle ABC$ is equilateral. $\\square$\n\n\\textbf{Method 2:} Observe that\n\n\\[\n\\frac{AE}{AH} = \\cos(\\angle HAE) = \\frac{AD}{AC} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{AF}{AH} = \\cos(\\angle HAF) = \\frac{AD}{AB}.\n\\]\n\nIt follows that\n\n\\[\nAC \\cdot AE = AH \\cdot AD = AB \\cdot AF.\n\\]\n\nBy symmetry, we similarly have\n\n\\[\nBC \\cdot BD = BH \\cdot BE = BF \\cdot BA \\quad \\text{and} \\quad CD \\cdot CB = CH \\cdot CF = CE \\cdot CA.\n\\]\n\nTherefore\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 2(AH \\cdot AD + BH \\cdot BE + CH \\cdot CF) \\\\\n&= AB(AF + BF) + AC(AE + CE) + BC(BD + CD) \\\\\n&= AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nThis proves Equation (1) in Method 1.

The flea will start at position $[1, C]$ from the left, which puts him at position $[nA, nA + C - 1]$ from the right. After $n-1$ jumps, he will still have $nA - (n-1)(A+C) = A - (n-1)C > C$ distance to go, which is not enough for a big jump to clear the lava. Thus, he must do at least $n$ jumps in the safe interval, but that's possible only with all small jumps, and furthermore is impossible if the starting position is $C$. This gives him starting position 1 higher in the next safe interval, so sooner or later the flea is going to hit the lava.\n\nFlea's strategy: The flea just does one interval at a time. If the safe interval has at least $nA + C$ integers in it, the flea has distance $d > nA$ to go to the next lava when it starts. Repeatedly do big jumps until $d$ is between 1 and $C \\bmod A$, then small jumps until the remaining distance is between 1 and $C$, then a final big jump. This works as long as the first part does. However, we get at least $n$ big jumps since $\\lfloor(d-1)/A\\rfloor$ can never go down two from a big jump (or we'd be done doing big jumps), so we get $n$ big jumps, and thus we are good if $d \\bmod A$ is in any of $[1, C], [C+1, 2C], \\dots [nC+1, (n+1)C],$ but that's everything. $\\square$\n\nLet $C = B - A$. We shall write our intervals of lava in the form $(L_i, R_i] = \\{L_i + 1, L_i + 2, \\dots, R_i\\}$, where $R_i = L_i + A$ and $R_{i-1} < L_i$ for every $i \\ge 1$. We also let $R_0 = 0$. We shall also represent a path for the flea as a sequence of integers $x_0, x_1, x_2, \\dots$ where $x_0 = 0$ and $x_j - x_{j-1} \\in \\{A, B\\}$ for every $j \\ge 0$.\n\nNow here is a detailed proof.\n\nFirst, assume $F < (n-1)A + B \\stackrel{=} {=} nA + C$): we must prove that Lavaman has a winning strategy. Let $L_i = R_{i-1} + nA + C - 1$ for every $i \\ge 1$. (Observe that $nA + C - 1 \\ge F$.)\n\nAssume that the flea has an infinite path that avoids all the lava, which\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Kanada_2016_p6_data_152adb9a21.png)\n\nmeans that $x_j \\notin (L_i, R_i]$ for all $i, j \\ge 1$. For each $i \\ge 1$, let\n\n$$\nM_i = \\max\\{x_j : x_j \\le L_i\\}, \\quad m_i = \\min\\{x_j : x_j > R_i\\}, \\\\ \\text{and} \\quad J(i) = \\max\\{j : x_j \\le L_i\\}.\n$$\n\nAlso let $m_0 = 0$. Then for $i \\ge 1$ we have\n\n$$\nM_i = x_{J(i)} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad m_i = x_{J(i)+1}.\n$$\n\nAlso, for every $i \\ge 1$, we have\n\n(a) $m_i = M_i + B$ (because $M_i + A \\le L_i + A = R_i$);\n\n(b) $L_i \\ge M_i > L_i - C$ (since $M_i = m_i - B > R_i - B = L_i + A - B$);\n\n(c) $R_i < m_i \\le R_i + C$ (since $m_i = M_i + B \\le L_i + B = R_i + C$).\n\n\\textbf{Claim 1:} $J(i+1) = J(i) + n + 1$ for every $i \\ge 1$. (That is, after jumping over one interval of lava, the flea must make exactly $n$ jumps before jumping over the next interval of lava.)\n\n\\textbf{Proof:}\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*} x_{J(i)+n+1} &\\le x_{J(i)+1} + Bn \\\\ &= m_i + Bn \\\\ &< R_i + C + \\left(A + \\frac{A}{n}\\right)n \\\\ &= L_{i+1} + A + 1. \\end{align*}\n$$\n\nBecause of the strict inequality, we have $x_{J(i)+n+1} \\le R_{i+1}$, and hence $x_{J(i)+n+1} \\le L_{i+1}$. Therefore $J(i) + n + 1 \\le J(i+1)$. Next, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*} x_{J(i)+n+1} &\\ge x_{J(i)+1} + An \\\\ &= m_i + An \\\\ &> R_i + An \\\\ &= L_{i+1} - C + 1 \\\\ &> L_{i+1} - A + 1 \\quad \\text{(since } C < A). \\end{align*}\n$$\n\nTherefore $x_{J(i)+n+2} \\ge x_{J(i)+n+1} + A > L_{i+1}$, and hence $J(i+1) < J(i) + n + 2$. Claim 1 follows.\n\n\\textbf{Claim 2:} $x_{j+1} - x_j = A$ for all $j = J(i) + 1, \\dots, J(i+1) - 1$, for all $i \\ge 1$. (That is, the $n$ intermediate jumps of Claim 1 must all be of",

The flea will start at position $[1, C]$ from the left, which puts him at position $[nA, nA + C - 1]$ from the right. After $n-1$ jumps, he will still have $nA - (n-1)(A+C) = A - (n-1)C > C$ distance to go, which is not enough for a big jump to clear the lava. Thus, he must do at least $n$ jumps in the safe interval, but that's possible only with all small jumps, and furthermore is impossible if the starting position is $C$. This gives him starting position 1 higher in the next safe interval, so sooner or later the flea is going to hit the lava.\n\nFlea's strategy: The flea just does one interval at a time. If the safe interval has at least $nA + C$ integers in it, the flea has distance $d > nA$ to go to the next lava when it starts. Repeatedly do big jumps until $d$ is between 1 and $C \\bmod A$, then small jumps until the remaining distance is between 1 and $C$, then a final big jump. This works as long as the first part does. However, we get at least $n$ big jumps since $\\lfloor(d-1)/A\\rfloor$ can never go down two from a big jump (or we'd be done doing big jumps), so we get $n$ big jumps, and thus we are good if $d \\bmod A$ is in any of $[1, C], [C+1, 2C], \\dots [nC+1, (n+1)C],$ but that's everything. $\\square$\n\nLet $C = B - A$. We shall write our intervals of lava in the form $(L_i, R_i] = \\{L_i + 1, L_i + 2, \\dots, R_i\\}$, where $R_i = L_i + A$ and $R_{i-1} < L_i$ for every $i \\ge 1$. We also let $R_0 = 0$. We shall also represent a path for the flea as a sequence of integers $x_0, x_1, x_2, \\dots$ where $x_0 = 0$ and $x_j - x_{j-1} \\in \\{A, B\\}$ for every $j \\ge 0$.\n\nNow here is a detailed proof.\n\nFirst, assume $F < (n-1)A + B \\stackrel{=} {=} nA + C$): we must prove that Lavaman has a winning strategy. Let $L_i = R_{i-1} + nA + C - 1$ for every $i \\ge 1$. (Observe that $nA + C - 1 \\ge F$.)\n\nAssume that the flea has an infinite path that avoids all the lava, which"

Therefore, $APDR$ is cyclic. This in turn implies that $\\angle PBE = \\angle PBH = \\angle PAH = \\angle PAD = \\angle PRD = \\angle PRE$, and so $PBRE$ is also cyclic.\n\nLet $F$ denote the base of the altitude from $C$ to $AB$. Then $D, E, F$, and $M$ all lie on the 9-point circle of $\\triangle ABC$, and so are cyclic.

We will show that $R' = R$, which will complete the proof.

In particular, $MQ = MQ'$.\n\nSince $\\angle AEB = \\angle ADB = 90^\\circ$, we furthermore know that $M$ is the circumcenter of both $\\triangle AEB$ and $\\triangle ADB$. Thus, $MA = ME = MD = MB$. By Power of a Point, we then have $MQ \\cdot MR' = MQ' \\cdot MR' = MA \\cdot MB = MD^2$. In particular, this means that the circumcircle of $\\triangle DR'Q$ is tangent to $MD$ at $D$, which means $\\angle MR'D = \\angle MDQ$.\nSimilarly $MQ \\cdot MR' = ME^2$, and so $\\angle MR'E = \\angle MEQ = \\angle MDQ = \\angle MR'D$.

Given a subset $T$, consider the subset $T^* = \\{n+1-t: t \\in T\\}$. It holds that $A(T^*) = n+1-A(T)$ and $M(T^*) = n+1-M(T)$, which implies that if $A(T) = M(T)$ then $A(T^*) = M(T^*)$. Pairing each set $T$ with $T^*$ yields that there are an even number of sets $T$ such that $A(T) = M(T)$ and $T \\neq T^*$.\n\nThus it suffices to show that the number of nonempty subsets $T$ such that $A(T) = M(T)$ and $T = T^*$ is odd. Now note that if $T = T^*$, then $A(T) = M(T) = \\frac{n+1}{2}$. Hence it suffices to show the number of nonempty subsets $T$ with $T = T^*$ is odd. Given such a set $T$, let $T'$ be the largest nonempty subset of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, \\lceil n/2 \\rceil\\}$ contained in $T$. Pairing $T$ with $T'$ forms a bijection between these sets $T$ and the nonempty subsets of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, \\lceil n/2 \\rceil\\}$. Thus there are $2^{\\lceil n/2 \\rceil} - 1$ such subsets, which is odd as desired. $\\square$",
