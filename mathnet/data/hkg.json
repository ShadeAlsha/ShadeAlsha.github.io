By the given assumptions on $X'$ and $Y'$, $P$ lies on $BX'$ and $Q$ lies on $BY'$. Note that $AB$ is perpendicular to $l$ and $\\angle APX' = 90^\\circ$, and hence $P'$ lies on $BX$ (as $B$ is the orthocentre of $\\triangle AXX'$). Apply Pascal's theorem to the hexagon $APQBP'Q'$, and we see that $X, PQ \\cap P'Q'$ and $Y'$ are collinear, i.e. $PQ$ and $P'Q'$ intersect on $l$ (or they are both parallel to $l$). Now consider the inversion at $A$ interchanging $\\Gamma$ and $l$, and we see that $(AXY)$ and $(AX'Y')$ become the lines $PQ$ and $P'Q'$ respectively. But we have seen that these two lines either intersect at a point on $l$ or both are parallel to $l$. In terms of circles, it means that $(AXY)$ and $(AX'Y')$ intersect at a point on $\\Gamma$ other than $A$, or they are both tangent to $\\Gamma$ at $A$. The proof is complete."
