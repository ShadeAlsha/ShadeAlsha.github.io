Let $X$ be the common point of $AB$ with the line through $I$ parallel to $CA$, and $Y$ be the common point of $CA$ with the line through $I$ parallel to $AB$. $AXIY$ is a parallelogram, and since $I$ is the incenter of $ABC$, we have $\\angle IAX = \\angle IAY$. Since $\\angle IAX = \\angle AIX$ must also hold in the parallelogram $AXIY$, we see that $\\angle IAX = \\angle AIX$ holds. The trinagle $AIX$ is therefore isosceles with $XA = XI$.

The sum of the areas of the triangles is given by the expression\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}a_1b_1 + \\frac{1}{2}a_2b_2 + \\frac{1}{2}a_3b_3.\n$$\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Austria_2010_p7_data_2720dca159.png)\n\nSince $b_1 + b_2 + b_3 = c = |AB|$ and $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = h_c$ obviously hold, and all three triangle are similar to $ABC$, we have\n\n$$\na_1 : a_2 : a_3 = b_1 : b_2 : b_3 = t_1 : t_2 : t_3 \\quad \\text{with} \\quad t_1 + t_2 + t_3 = 1.\n$$\n\nIt therefore follows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} \\frac{1}{2}a_1b_1 + \\frac{1}{2}a_2b_2 + \\frac{1}{2}a_3b_3 &= \\frac{1}{2}h_c \\cdot c \\cdot (t_1^2 + t_2^2 + t_3^2) \\\\ &\\geq h_c \\cdot c \\cdot \\left( \\frac{t_1 + t_2 + t_3}{2} \\right)^2 \\\\ &= \\frac{h_c \\cdot c}{4}, \\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith equality holding iff $t_1 = t_2 = t_3 = \\frac{1}{3}$.

If $p = 3$, we obtain $x = 7$, $y = 3$ and $z = 4$ again contradicting $y > z$.

Since we know $c_0 = c_1 = 0$ and $c_2 = 1$, we obtain the system of equations\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nA + B + C &= 0 \\\\\nA + (2 + \\sqrt{3})B + (2 - \\sqrt{3})C &= 0 \\\\\nA + (7 + 4\\sqrt{3})B + (7 - 4\\sqrt{3})C &= 1.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSolving this system of equations yields $A = -\\frac{1}{2}$, $B = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{12}$ and $C = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{12}$, and the number of possible paths is therefore given by the expression\n\n$$\nc_n = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{(3 - \\sqrt{3})(2 + \\sqrt{3})^n}{12} + \\frac{(3 + \\sqrt{3})(2 - \\sqrt{3})^n}{12}.\n$$\n\nqed",

The rectangles can either be in the form of three \"strips\" (i.e. all with one side of length 2010) or there can be one such strip, with the other two rectangles resulting from a cut at right angles to the first cut.\n\nWe first consider the case of the three strips. Since the areas of the strips are all equal to 2010 times their width, they must be such that the middle one has a width that is the arithmetic mean of the widths of the other two. Since 2010 : 3 = 670, the width of the middle strip is certainly 670, and the width of the smallest strip can be any integer less than or equal to 670. There are therefore 670 possible dissections in this case.\n\nWe now consider the other option. Naming the areas of the three strips A, B and C with $B = \\frac{A+C}{2}$ and $A \\le C$, we again have two possible cases. The rectangle with area B can either be the strip or one of the other rectangles.\n\nLet us assume that the strip has area B. Since its area is one third of the area of the square, this rectangle has the dimensions $670 \\times 2010$. The other two together therefore have the dimensions $1340 \\times 2010$, and the common edge must be of length $1340$. Since $A < C$ the shorter edge of the rectangle with area A can be any integer from 1 to $2010 : 2 = 1005$, and there are therefore 1005 possible dissections in this case.\n\nFinally, we assume that the strip, which has the dimensions $a \\times 2010$, either has area A or C. There must then exist an integer $b < 2010$, so that we can write $B = (2010-a) \\cdot b = 670 \\cdot 2010$. Since $67^2|670 \\cdot 2010$ and $67^2 > 2010$, both $a$ and $b$ must be divisible by 67, and we can write $a = 67c$ and $b = 67d$. Substituting, we therefore obtain $(30-c) \\cdot d = 300$ with $d < 30$. Since $30-c < 30$ also holds, we also have $d > 10$. $d$ must therefore be a divisor of 300 between 10 and 30, which yields possible values 12, 15, 20 and 25 for $d$. This yields possible values of 5, 10, 15 and 18 for $c$, which in turns yields possible values of 335, 670, 1005 and 1206 for $a$. The value $a = 670$ was already counted in the previous case, however, since this is the case for which $A = B = C$ holds. We therefore have possible dissections that have not already been counted.\n\nIn total, we obtain $670 + 1005 + 3 = 1678$ possible dissections which the required properties.\n\nqed",

Any possible solution in this case must therefore have $x = 2^p + 1$, $y = 2^{p-1} + 1$ and therefore $z = p + 1$. If $p = 2$, we obtain $x = 5$ and $y = z = 3$, which contradicts $y > z$.

The rectangles can either be in the form of three \"strips\" (i.e. all with one side of length 2010) or there can be one such strip, with the other two rectangles resulting from a cut at right angles to the first cut.\n\nWe first consider the case of the three strips. Since the areas of the strips are all equal to 2010 times their width, they must be such that the middle one has a width that is the arithmetic mean of the widths of the other two. Since 2010 : 3 = 670, the width of the middle strip is certainly 670, and the width of the smallest strip can be any integer less than or equal to 670. There are therefore 670 possible dissections in this case.\n\nWe now consider the other option. Naming the areas of the three strips A, B and C with $B = \\frac{A+C}{2}$ and $A \\le C$, we again have two possible cases. The rectangle with area B can either be the strip or one of the other rectangles.\n\nLet us assume that the strip has area B. Since its area is one third of the area of the square, this rectangle has the dimensions $670 \\times 2010$. The other two together therefore have the dimensions $1340 \\times 2010$, and the common edge must be of length 1340. Since $A < C$ the shorter edge of the rectangle with area A can be any integer from 1 to $2010 : 2 = 1005$, and there are therefore 1005 possible dissections in this case.\n\nFinally, we assume that the strip, which has the dimensions $a \\times 2010$, either has area A or C. There must then exist an integer $b < 2010$, so that we can write $B = (2010-a) \\cdot b = 670 \\cdot 2010$. Since $67^2|670 \\cdot 2010$ and $67^2 > 2010$, both a and b must be divisible by 67, and we can write $a = 67c$ and $b = 67d$. Substituting, we therefore obtain $(30-c) \\cdot d = 300$ with $d < 30$. Since $30-c < 30$ also holds, we also have $d > 10$. d must therefore be a divisor of 300 between 10 and 30, which yields possible values 12, 15, 20 and 25 for d. This yields possible values of 5, 10, 15 and 18 for c, which in turns yields possible values of 335, 670, 1005 and 1206 for a. The value $a = 670$ was already counted in the previous case, however, since this is the case for which $A=B=C$ holds. We therefore have possible dissections that have not already been counted.\n\nIn total, we obtain $670 + 1005 + 3 = 1678$ possible dissections which the required properties.\n\nqed",

Inclusion of $N$ in the sequence will therefore certainly not raise the value of the lcm, and no such $N$ can be included in the sequence $\\langle a_n \\rangle$.\n\nSummarizing, we note that the sequence $\\langle a_n \\rangle$ is composed of the number 1 and all powers of\nprimes in ascending order.\nqed",

We claim that there are no other solutions.\n\nIn order to show this, we first assume that $z$ is even. In this case, the number $7^2y^2$ is a perfect square, and therefore $x^4 + x^2 = x^2(x^2 + 1)$ must also be a perfect square. The only value of $x$ for which both $x^2$ and $x^2 + 1$ can be perfect squares is 0, and we therefore have $x = 0$ (and thus also $y = 0$) in this case.\n\nNow, assume that $z$ is positive and odd. Let $z = 2c + 1$. Since $x^2(x^2 + 1)$ is divisible by 7 and $x^2 + 1$ can only be congruent to 1, 2, 3 or 5 modulo 7, it follows that $x$ must be divisible by 7. Let $x = 7^a u$ and $y = 7^b v$ with $u$ and $v$ not divisible by 7. The given equation can now be written as\n\n$7^{2a}u^2(7^{2a}u^2 + 1) = 7^{2(b+c)+1}v^2,$\n\nwhich yields a contradiction, since the left-hand side of this expression is exactly divisible by\nan even number of sevens, while the right-hand side is exactly divisible by an odd number of\nsevens.\n\nFinally, assume that $z$ is negative and let $z = -w$. In this case the equation can be written in the equivalent form $7^w x^2 (x^2 + 1) = y^2$. If $w$ is even, we once again note that both $x^2$ and $x^2 + 1$ must be perfect squares, and as before this means that $x = y = 0$ must follow. If $w$ is odd, we can write $w = 2c + 1$, and the same argument as before will hold, with $x = 7^a u$ and $y = 7^b v$ yielding $7^{2(a+c)+1} u^2 (7^{2a} u^2 + 1) = 7^{2b} v^2$ as a contradiction.\nqed",

It is certainly equidistant from $A$ and $B$. We now consider the triangle $AIM$. Naming the angles in $A, B$ and $C$, $\\alpha, \\beta$ and $\\gamma$ as usual, we note that $\\angle MAI = \\frac{\\alpha}{2} + \\angle BAM = \\frac{\\alpha}{2} + \\angle BCM = \\frac{\\alpha}{2} + \\frac{\\gamma}{2}$. Furthermore, $\\angleIMA = \\angle CMA = \\angle CBA = \\beta$, and we therefore have $\\angle MIA = 180^\\circ - \\angleIMA - \\angleAIM = 180^\\circ - \\beta - (\\frac{\\alpha}{2} + \\frac{\\gamma}{2}) = \\frac{\\alpha}{2} + \\frac{\\gamma}{2}$.

We therefore have $MU = MV$. Since $MA = MP = MB = MQ$, we now see that the triangles $AMP$ and $BMQ$ are both isosceles with the same side lengths and the same altitudes, and are therefore also congruent, from which it follows that $AP = BQ$ holds.\n\nThe quadrilateral $AQBP$ is therefore inscribed and has two sides of the same length, and is therefore a trapezoid, as claimed.\n\nWe also see that neither $AC$ nor $BC$ can be a tangent of $k$. If either were a tangent, the two (congruent) triangles $AMP$ and $BMC$ would both degenerate to segments perpendicular to $AC$ and $BC$ respectively. Both lines would therefore be tangent to $k$, and since the tangent segments would therefore be of equal length, it would follow that $ABC$ is isosceles, which is a contradiction to the assumption that it is not.

We see that $(1,0)$ is also a solution.\n\nFor $b = 0$, we obtain $n = 1$ and $m = 1$, and again $n|m$. $(a,0)$ is therefore a solution for all values of a.\n\nWe now consider the general case, where $a > 1$ and $b > 0$. Since\n\n$$\na^b + b | a^{2b} + 2b = (a^b)^2 - b^2 + (b^2 + 2b) = (a^b + b)(a^b - b) + b(b+2),\n$$\n\nwe see that $a^b + b | b(b+2)$ must hold. For $b=1$, we must have $a+1|3$, and therefore $a=2$. The only solution in this case is therefore $(2, 1)$.\n\nWe now consider large values of $a$, specifically $a \\ge 3$. For $a=3$, we have $n = 3^b + b$, and we can show that $3^b + b > b(b+2) \\iff 3^b > b(b+1)$, which yields a contradiction. We show this by induction. For $b=1$, we have $3 > 1 \\cdot 2$, which is certainly true. If we can now assume that $3^k > k(k+1)$ is true, and wish to show $3^{k+1}) > (k+1)((k+1)+1)$, we note that the latter expression results from the former by multiplying the left side with 3 and the right side with $\\frac{k+2}{k}$, which is certainly not greater than 3, which proves the induction. If $a > 3$, we have $n > 3^b + b$, which is then also certainly impossible.\n\nFinally, the case $a=2$ remains. As before, we can show that $2^b > b(b+1)$ for $b > 5$ (noting $32 > 30$). The only possible values for $b$ remaining are therefore 2, 3 and 4. For $b=2$, we would have $6|8$, for $b=3$ we would have $11|21$, and for $b=4$ we would have $20|24$, none of which is true.\n\nIn summary, the solutions are $(2, 1)$, all pairs $(a, 0)$ and all pairs $(0, b)$. qed",

Inclusion of $N$ in the sequence will therefore certainly not raise the value of the lcm, and no such $N$ can be included in the sequence $\\langle a_n \\rangle$.\n\nSummarizing, we note that the sequence $\\langle a_n \\rangle$ is composed of the number 1 and all powers of primes in ascending order. qed",

We claim that there are no other solutions.\n\nIn order to show this, we first assume that $z$ is even. In this case, the number $7^z y^2$ is a perfect square, and therefore $x^4 + x^2 = x^2(x^2 + 1)$ must also be a perfect square. The only value of $x$ for which both $x^2$ and $x^2 + 1$ can be perfect squares is 0, and we therefore have $x = 0$ (and thus also $y = 0$) in this case.\n\nNow, assume that $z$ is positive and odd. Let $z = 2c + 1$. Since $x^2(x^2 + 1)$ is divisible by 7 and $x^2 + 1$ can only be congruent to 1, 2, 3 or 5 modulo 7, it follows that $x$ must be divisible by 7. Let $x = 7^a u$ and $y = 7^b v$ with $u$ and $v$ not divisible by 7. The given equation can now be written as\n\n$$\n7^{2a}u^2(7^{2a}u^2 + 1) = 7^{2(b+c)+1}v^2,\n$$\n\nwhich yields a contradiction, since the left-hand side of this expression is exactly divisible by an even number of sevens, while the right-hand side is exactly divisible by an odd number of sevens.\n\nFinally, assume that $z$ is negative and let $z = -w$. In this case the equation can be written in the equivalent form $7^w x^2(x^2 + 1) = y^2$. If $w$ is even, we once again note that both $x^2$ and $x^2 + 1$ must be perfect squares, and as before this means that $x = y = 0$ must follow. If $w$ is odd, we can write $w = 2c + 1$, and the same argument as before will hold, with $x = 7^a u$ and $y = 7^b v$ yielding $7^{2(a+c)+1}u^2(7^{2a}u^2 + 1) = 7^{2b}v^2$ as a contradiction. qed",

Both lines would therefore be tangent to k, and since the tangent segments would therefore be of equal length, it would follow that ABC is isosceles, which is a contradiction to the assumption that it is not. This completes our proof. qed",

We see that $(0,0)$ is a solution.\n\nFor $a = 0$ and $b > 0$, we obtain $n = b$ and $m = 2b$, and again $n|m$. We see that $(0, b)$ is, in fact a solution for all values of b.\n\nFor $a = 1$, we obtain $n = b + 1$ and $m = 2b + 1$. The only way $(b+1)|(2b+1)$ can hold is for $b = 0$. We see that $(1, 0)$ is also a solution.\n\nFor $b = 0$, we obtain $n = 1$ and $m = 1$, and again $n|m$. $(a, 0)$ is therefore a solution for all values of a.\n\nWe now consider the general case, where $a > 1$ and $b > 0$. Since\n\n$$\na^b + b | a^{2b} + 2b = (a^b)^2 - b^2 + (b^2 + 2b) = (a^b + b)(a^b - b) + b(b + 2),\n$$\n\nwe see that $a^b + b | b(b+2)$ must hold. For $b=1$, we must have $a+1|3$, and therefore $a=2$. The only solution in this case is therefore $(2, 1)$.\n\nWe now consider large values of $a$, specifically $a \\ge 3$. For $a=3$, we have $n = 3^b + b$, and we can show that $3^b + b > b(b+2) \\iff 3^b > b(b+1)$, which yields a contradiction. We show this by induction. For $b=1$, we have $3 > 1 \\cdot 2$, which is certainly true. If we can now assume that $3^k > k(k+1)$ is true, and wish to show $3^{k+1}) > (k+1)((k+1)+1)$, we note that the latter expression results from the former by multiplying the left side with 3 and the right side with $\\frac{k+2}{k}$, which is certainly not greater than 3, which proves the induction. If $a > 3$, we have $n > 3^b + b$, which is then also certainly impossible.\n\nFinally, the case $a=2$ remains. As before, we can show that $2^b > b(b+1)$ for $b > 5$ (noting $32 > 30$). The only possible values for $b$ remaining are therefore 2, 3 and 4. For $b=2$, we would have $6|8$, for $b=3$ we would have $11|21$, and for $b=4$ we would have $20|24$, none of which is true.\n\nIn summary, the solutions are $(2, 1)$, all pairs $(a, 0)$ and all pairs $(0, b)$. qed",

In this case we can divide the given equation by $n$, which yields the equivalent equation\n\n$$\n(n - 1)! + A = n^{k-1}.\n$$\n\nWe now turn our attention to the case $A = 7$.\n\nIf $n = 2$, the equation yields $1 + 7 = 2^{k-1}$, which is true for $k = 4$, yielding the solution $(n, k) = (2, 4)$. If $n > 2$, $(n - 1)!$ is even, and $n^{k-1}$ and therefore $n$ must be odd. If $n = 3$, we have $(3 - 1)! + 7 = 3^{3-1}$, and we see that $(n, k) = (3, 3)$ is another solution. We now wish to show that there are no others.\n\nFor $n \\in \\{5, 7, 11, 13\\}$ Wilson's theorem yields $(n - 1)! + 7 \\equiv -1 + 7 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{n}$, which means that this expression cannot be a power of $n$.

Finally, for $n \\ge 15$ we note that $0 \\equiv (n - 1)! + 7 \\equiv n^{k-1} \\pmod{7}$, which implies $7|n$. Since we obviously also have $7^2|(n - 1)!$ in this case, it follows that $0 \\equiv n^{k-1} \\equiv (n - 1)! + 7 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{7}$, which once more yields a contradiction.\n\nThe only case left to check is $k = 2$, but this yields the equation $(n - 1)! + 7 = n$, which cannot hold because of $(n - 1)! + 7 \\ge (n - 1) + 7 > n$, and we see that the only two non-trivial solutions in this case are $(2, 4)$ and $(3, 3)$.\n\nNow, let us consider the case $A = 2012$.

Since $N^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ holds for all odd values of $N$, the values of $n$ with the required property are exactly the numbers $N = 1006 \\cdot u + 1$ and $N = 1006 \\cdot v - 1$. Since $1006 \\cdot 995 = 1000970$ and $1006 \\cdot 994 = 999964$, only $0 \\le u \\le 994$ and $1 \\le v \\le 994$ are possible, and the required number of integers $N$ is equal to $995 + 994 = 1989$. $\\square$",

In this case we can divide the given equation by $n$, which yields the equivalent equation\n\n$$\n(n - 1)! + A = n^{k-1}.\n$$\n\nWe now turn our attention to the case $A = 7$.\n\nIf $n = 2$, the equation yields $1 + 7 = 2^{k-1}$, which is true for $k = 4$, yielding the solution $(n, k) = (2, 4)$. If $n > 2$, $(n-1)!$ is even, and $n^{k-1}$ and therefore $n$ must be odd. If $n = 3$, we have $(3-1)! + 7 = 3^{3-1}$, and we see that $(n, k) = (3, 3)$ is another solution. We now wish to show that there are no others.\n\nFor $n \\in \\{5, 7, 11, 13\\}$ Wilson's theorem yields $(n-1)! + 7 \\equiv -1 + 7 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{n}$, which means that this expression cannot be a power of $n$.

Finally, for $n \\ge 15$ we note that $0 \\equiv (n-1)! + 7 \\equiv n^{k-1} \\pmod{7}$, which implies $7|n$. Since we obviously also have $7^2|(n-1)!$ in this case, it follows that $0 \\equiv n^{k-1} \\equiv (n-1)! + 7 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{7}$, which once more yields a contradiction.\n\nThe only case left to check is $k = 2$, but this yields the equation $(n-1)! + 7 = n$, which cannot hold because of $(n-1)! + 7 \\ge (n-1) + 7 > n$. and we see that the only two non-trivial solutions in this case are $(2, 4)$ and $(3, 3)$.\n\nNow, let us consider the case $A = 2012$. We will show that there are no non-trivial solutions in this case.\n\nFor $n = 2$ the equation reduces to $2^{k-1} = 2^{k-1}$, which obviously has no integer solution. For $n > 2$, we have $2|(n-1)!$, and therefore $n^{k-1} = (n-1)! + 2012 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$, which implies $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$. $n = 4$ yields $2018 = 4^{k-1}$ for the equation, which again has no integer solution.

From $a_2 = 1$ we therefore get $a_{2n+2} = 3^n = a_{2n-1}$ and $b_{2n} = 2 \\cdot 3^{n-1}$.\n\nIn order to obtain the number $s_n = 2a_n + b_n$ of all colorings, we note\n\n$$\ns_{2n+2} = 2a_{2n+2} + b_{2n+2} = 2 \\cdot 3^n + 2 \\cdot 3^n = 4 \\cdot 3^n\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\ns_{2n+1} = 2a_{2n+1} + b_{2n+1} = 2 \\cdot 3^n.\n$$\n\nThis can be summarized in the expression $s_n = (3 + (-1)^n) \\cdot 3^{\\lfloor \\frac{n-1}{2} \\rfloor}$. $\\square$",

          "latex": "The square divides the circle into four arcs. None of them can contain more than one of the triangle vertices, because the distance between two triangle vertices is equivalent to an inner angle of $120^\\circ$, whereas the distance between two vertices of the square is only equivalent to an inner angle of $90^\\circ$. Therefore, the triangle vertices must be on three distinct parts of the circle.\n\nLet $ABCD$ denote the square and let $PQR$ denote the triangle. Without loss of generality, let us assume that $P$ is on the arc between $A$ and $B$, that $Q$ is between $B$ and $C$, and that $R$ is between $D$ and $A$, as shown in the graph below.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/AustriaMO2013_p10_data_0e830fd903.png)\n\nWe see that the heptagon is combined of the square $ABCD$ and the three triangles $APB$, $BQC$ and $DRA$. Since the size of the square $ABCD$ is constant, it is sufficient to maximize resp. minimize the sum of the areas of these three triangles.\n\nLet $h_1$ denote the distance between point $P$ and line $AB$ (i.e., the height of triangle $APB$), let $h_2$ denote the distance between point $Q$ and line $BC$, and let $h_3$ denote the distance between point R and line DA. The sum of the areas of the three triangles can thus be calculated as $\\frac{|AB|}{2} \\cdot h_1 + \\frac{|BC|}{2} \\cdot h_2 + \\frac{|DA|}{2} \\cdot h_3 = \\frac{s}{2} \\cdot (h_1 + h_2 + h_3)$, where $s$ denotes the length of each side of the square. Since $s$ is constant, it is therefore sufficient to maximize resp. minimize the sum $(h_1 + h_2 + h_3)$.\n\nWe will do this by separately maximizing resp. minimizing the height $h_1$, and the sum of the heights $h_2 + h_3$.\n\nThe height $h_1$ is largest when $P$ is exactly in the middle of the arc between $A$ and $B$.\n\nFor maximizing the sum $h_2+h_3$, consider the rectangle $QXRY$ with sides parallel to the sides of the square $ABCD$ and with $QR$ as one of its diagonals. By Pythagoras it holds that $|QR|^2 = |QX|^2 + |XR|^2 = (h_1+s+h_2)^2 + |XR|^2$, and therefore $(h_2+s+h_3)^2 = |QR|^2 - |XR|^2$. Since the length of the triangle side $QR$ is constant, the expression (and consequently the sum $h_2+h_3$) is largest when $|XR| = 0$. This is the case if side $QR$ is parallel to side $CD$, or equivalently, if $P$ is exactly in the middle of the arc between $A$ and $B$.\n\nSince $h_1$ and the sum $h_2+h_3$ are both maximized in the same case, the sum of all three is also largest when $P$ is exactly in the middle of the arc between $A$ and $B$.\n\nFor determining the minimum, we again separately look at $h_1$ and the sum $h_2+h_3$ and minimize them under the condition that the triangle vertices must remain on the correct parts of the circle.\n\nThe height $h_1$ becomes smaller the closer $P$ moves towards either $A$ or $B$. Since $Q$ must remain between $B$ and $C$, and $R$ must remain between $D$ and $A$, the minimum is reached if either $Q = C$ or $R = D$.\n\nLikewise, the sum $h_2+h_3$ becomes smaller if $|XR|$ becomes larger, so again the minimum is reached if $Q = C$ or $R = D$. $\\square$",

None of them can contain more than one of the triangle vertices, because the distance between two triangle vertices is equivalent to an inner angle of 120\\degree, whereas the distance between two vertices of the square is only equivalent to an inner angle of 90\\degree. Therefore, the triangle vertices must be on three distinct parts of the circle.\n\nLet $ABCD$ denote the square and let $PQR$ denote the triangle. Without loss of generality, let us assume that $P$ is on the arc between $A$ and $B$, that $Q$ is between $B$ and $C$, and that $R$ is between $D$ and $A$, as shown in the graph below.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Austrija_2013_p9_data_bb3fbf6ed0.png)\n\nWe see that the heptagon is combined of the square $ABCD$ and the three triangles $APB$, $BQC$ and $DRA$. Since the size of the square $ABCD$ is constant, it is sufficient to maximize resp. minimize the sum of the areas of these three triangles.\n\nLet $h_1$ denote the distance between point $P$ and line $AB$ (i.e., the height of triangle $APB$), let $h_2$ denote the distance between point $Q$ and line $BC$, and let $h_3$ denote the distance between point $R$ and line $DA$. The sum of the areas of the three triangles can thus be calculated as $\\frac{|AB|}{2} \\cdot h_1 + \\frac{|BC|}{2} \\cdot h_2 + \\frac{|DA|}{2} \\cdot h_3 = \\frac{s}{2} \\cdot (h_1 + h_2 + h_3)$, where $s$ denotes the length of each side of the square. Since $s$ is constant, it is therefore sufficient to maximize resp. minimize the sum $\\{h_1 + h_2 + h_3\\}$.\n\nWe will do this by separately maximizing resp. minimizing the height $h_1$, and the sum of the heights $h_2 + h_3$.\n\nThe height $h_1$ is largest when $P$ is exactly in the middle of the arc between $A$ and $B$.\n\nFor maximizing the sum $h_2+h_3$, consider the rectangle $QXRY$ with sides parallel to the sides of the square $ABCD$ and with $QR$ as one of its diagonals. By Pythagoras it holds that $|QR|^2 = |QX|^2 + |XR|^2 = (h_1+s+h_2)^2 + |XR|^2$, and therefore $(h_2+s+h_3)^2 = |QR|^2 - |XR|^2$. Since the length of the triangle side $QR$ is constant, the expression (and consequently the sum $h_2+h_3$) is largest when $|XR| = 0$. This is the case if side $QR$ is parallel to side $CD$, or equivalently, if $P$ is exactly in the middle of the arc between $A$ and $B$.\n\nSince $h_1$ and the sum $h_2+h_3$ are both maximized in the same case, the sum of all three is also largest when $P$ is exactly in the middle of the arc between $A$ and $B$.\n\nFor determining the minimum, we again separately look at $h_1$ and the sum $h_2+h_3$ and minimize them under the condition that the triangle vertices must remain on the correct parts of the circle.\n\nThe height $h_1$ becomes smaller the closer $P$ moves towards either $A$ or $B$. Since $Q$ must remain between $B$ and $C$, and $R$ must remain between $D$ and $A$, the minimum is reached if either $Q = C$ or $R = D$.\n\nLikewise, the sum $h_2+h_3$ becomes smaller if $|XR|$ becomes larger, so again the minimum is reached if $Q = C$ or $R = D$. $\\square$",

We now determine all $n \\ge 2015$ with $f(n) = n$. We write $n = p_1^{\\alpha_1} \\cdots p_r^{\\alpha_r}$. Then\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\alpha_1}{p_1} + \\cdots + \\frac{\\alpha_r}{p_r} = 1. \\qquad (5)\n\\]\n\nWe write\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\alpha_1}{p_1} + \\cdots + \\frac{\\alpha_{r-1}}{p_{r-1}} = \\frac{a}{p_1 \\cdots p_{r-1}}\n\\]\n\nfor some non-negative integer $a$. Then\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{p_1 \\cdots p_{r-1}} + \\frac{\\alpha_r}{p_r} = 1 \\iff ap_r + \\alpha_r p_1 \\cdots p_{r-1} = p_1 \\cdots p_r.\n\\]\n\nAs $p_r$ is coprime to $p_1 \\cdots p_{r-1}$, we conclude that $p_r \\mid \\alpha_r$. As (5) implies $\\alpha_r \\le p_r$, we conclude that $r=1$ and $\\alpha_r = p_r$.\n\nThus $f(n) = n$ holds if and only if $n = p^\\alpha$ for some prime number $p$. We have\n\n\\[\n2^2 = 4 < 3^3 = 27 < 2015 < 5^5 = 3125,\n\\]\n\nso the smallest such $n$ is 3125.\n\n(Clemens Heuberger) $\\square$",

Angle $\\angle CED$ is supplementary to $\\angle AED$, which is itself supplementary to $\\angle ABC$ because the quadrilateral is circumscribed, and therefore $\\angle CED = \\angle ABC$ holds. It follows that triangles $CED$ and $CBA$ are similar.\n\nWe now reflect along the angle bisector of $\\angle BCA$ and then perform a homothety, such that $D$ is mapped onto $A$. Since the triangles $CED$ and $CBA$ are similar, this must map $E$ onto $B$. Since $AQB$ is congruent to $BPA$, which is itself similar to $DPE$, triangle $DPE$ is mapped onto $AQB$, and therefore $P$ onto $Q$. It therefore follows that $\\angle ACP = \\angle QCB$ holds, as required.\n\nNow, we prove the converse direction under the additional assumption that $P$ does not lie on $CM$. We assume that $\\angle ACP = \\angle BCQ$. The lemma then implies that $C'CD'E'$ is circumscribed. Applying the result on the first direction on the triangle $CC'A$ instead of $ABC$ implies $\\angle C'AQ = \\angle CAP$. It therefore follows from the lemma that $ABDE$ lie on a common circle.\n\nIf $P$ lies on $CM$ and $\\angle ACP = \\angle BCQ$ holds, $C, P, M$ and $Q$ are all points on the angle bisector. It then follows that $ABC$ is isosceles, and since $P$ lies on the axis of symmetry, we see that $ED \\parallel AB$ holds. It follows that $ABDE$ is an isosceles trapezoid, and it is therefore circumscribed.\n\n(Levi Haunschmid, Sara Kropf) $\\Box$",

Therefore\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/bwf2015englishSolutions_p1_data_0112e3da1c.png)\n\nbecause of the equal angles on the chord $D'E'$.\n\n2. Since $\\angle C'AQ = \\angle PBC$ also holds because of the symmetry, this follows as above.\n\nWe first prove that if $ABDE$ is circumscribed, then $\\angle ACP = \\angle QCB$.\n\nLet $ABDE$ be circumscribed, as in Figure 2. Since $BQ$ lies symmetric to $AP$ with respect to $M$,\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/bwf2015englishSolutions_p2_data_cb7e195a8b.png)\n\nFigure 2: Problem 2\n\n$AQBP$ is a parallelogram. Angle $\\angle CED$ is supplementary to $\\angle AED$, which is itself supplementary to $\\angle ABC$ because the quadrilateral is circumscribed, and therefore $\\angle CED = \\angle ABC$ holds. It follows that triangles $CED$ and $CBA$ are similar.\n\nWe now reflect along the angle bisector of $\\angle BCA$ and then perform a homothety, such that $D$ is mapped onto $A$. Since the triangles $CED$ and $CBA$ are similar, this must map $E$ onto $B$. Since $AQB$ is congruent to $BPA$, which is itself similar to $DPE$, triangle $DPE$ is mapped onto $AQB$, and therefore $P$ onto $Q$. It therefore follows that $\\angle ACP = \\angle QCB$ holds, as required.\n\nNow, we prove the converse direction under the additional assumption that $P$ does not lie on $CM$. We assume that $\\angle ACP = \\angle BCQ$. The lemma then implies that $C'CD'E'$ is circumscribed. Applying the result on the first direction on the triangle $CC'A$ instead of $ABC$ implies $\\angle C'AQ = \\angle CAP$. It therefore follows from the lemma that $ABDE$ lie on a common circle.\n\nIf $P$ lies on $CM$ and $\\angle ACP = \\angle BCQ$ holds, $C, P, M$ and $Q$ are all points on the angle bisector. It then follows that $ABC$ is isosceles, and since $P$ lies on the axis of symmetry, we see that $ED \\parallel AB$ holds. It follows that $ABDE$ is an isosceles trapezoid, and it is therefore circumscribed.\n\n(Levi Haunschmid, Sara Kropf) $\\Box$",

We note that\n\\[\n\\angle EAS = \\angle BAS - \\angle BAO = \\frac{\\alpha}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}(180^\\circ - \\angle AOB) = \\frac{\\alpha}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}(180^\\circ - 2\\gamma) = \\frac{\\alpha}{2} + \\gamma - 90^\\circ -\n\\]\n\nSince we also have\n\\[\n\\angle SAT = \\angle SAC - \\angle DAC = \\frac{\\alpha}{2} - (90^\\circ - \\angle ACD) = \\frac{\\alpha}{2} + \\gamma - 90^\\circ\n\\]\n\nit therefore follows that $\\angle EAS = \\angle TAS$ holds. Since we also have $AE = AT = 2R$, triangles ASE and AST are congruent, and therefore $\\angle AST = \\angle ASE$ follows. Since AE is a diameter of the circumcircle, we have $\\angle ASE = 90^\\circ$, and the claim is proven.",

Therefore, the game will certainly end if there are less tokens than neighboring pairs.\n\nConversely, if the number of tokens equals the number of neighboring pairs, we can find a never-ending game in the following way: Color the cells black and white in a checkerboard fashion and assign to each black cell a number of tokens that equals the number of its neighbors. Now we will simply choose all the black cells until all tokens are on the white cells, then repeat with the white cells and then iterate from the start.\n\nThe desired quantity is therefore the number of neighboring pairs minus 1.

Therefore, no number is at the same time column minimum and row maximum, so no number is super-plus-good.\n\n(b) This is true. Denote the number in the $a$th row and $b$th column by $F(a, b)$. Assume that there exist two super-plus-good numbers, and let $(i, j)$ and $(r, s)$ be the coordinates of these two numbers. Since all numbers are different, the row maxima and column minima are unique. Therefore no row and no column may contain more than one super-plus-good number, so $i \\neq r$ and $j \\neq s$ must hold. Then\n\n\\[\nF(i, j) > F(i, s) \\quad (\\text{because } F(i, j) \\text{ is row maximum}).\n\\]\n\n\\[\nF(i, j) < F(r, j) \\quad (\\text{because } F(i, j) \\text{ is column minimum}).\n\\]\n\n\\[\nF(r, s) > F(r, j) \\quad (\\text{because } F(r, s) \\text{ is row maximum}).\n\\]\n\n\\[\nF(r, s) < F(i, s) \\quad (\\text{because } F(r, s) \\text{ is column minimum}).\n\\]\n\nThese four inequalities lead to the following contradiction:\n\n\\[\nF(i, j) > F(i, s) > F(r, s) > F(r, j) > F(i, j).\n\\]",
