Just consider the points $(\\frac{3}{4}, 0, 0)$, $(0, \\frac{3}{4}, 0)$, $(1, \\frac{1}{4}, 1)$ and $(\\frac{1}{4}, 1, 1)$.\n\nNow suppose that there is a square with side $\\ell > \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{4}$ inside the cube. First, it's not hard to prove that we can suppose without loss of generality that the centers of the cube and of the square coincide. If it isn't the case, consider the three planes that cut the cube in two blocks with dimensions $\\frac{1}{2}, 1, 1$. Now focus on only one of the planes, which we'll call $\\alpha$. If the center of the square is not in $\\alpha$, it is inside one of the two blocks defined by the plane. Next, draw a plane $\\beta$ passing through the center of the square and parallel to $\\alpha$. It cuts the square in two congruent pieces and the cube in two blocks, one smaller than the other. Half of the square is inside the smaller block, so if we perform a translation that transforms $\\beta$ in $\\alpha$ there wouldn't be any problems, that is, the square won't go outside the cube. Repeating this procedure two more times with the two other planes, the center of the square will eventually coincide with the center of the cube.\n\nThe next step is to draw a sphere $S$ with center on the center of the square (which now coincides with the center of the cube) and radius $\\frac{\\ell\\sqrt{2}}{2} > \\frac{3}{4}$. Note that all vertices of the square will lie on the surface of $S$ and that two opposite vertices of the square will be antipodal on $S$. Then we know where are the vertices of the square: each is in one of the 8 regions determined by the intersection of the surface of $S$ and the cube. One vertex is in one of these regions, say $R$; the other one lies on the opposite region, say $T$.\n\nNow consider a block containing two neighbour regions. This block has dimensions $1, x$ and $x$. Recalling that $S$ has radius bigger than $\\frac{3}{4}$, then $x$ is less than $\\frac{1}{2} - \\sqrt{(\\frac{3}{4})^2 - (\\frac{\\ell\\sqrt{2}}{2})^2} = \\frac{1}{4}$. But then the maximum distance between any two points inside the block is less than $\\sqrt{1^2 + 2x^2} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{4}$, so it is impossible to have two vertices of the square in two neighbour regions. But $R$ eliminates three regions and $T$ eliminate the other three remaining regions. The other two vertices of the square won't have any region to go, contradiction.\n\nThus the biggest square contained in the cube has side $\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{4}$.",

The number of charged batteries needed is still two.\n\nOne can see that the order of the attempts doesn't matter and that a set of attempts is always successful if and only if in every set of $n$ batteries there is an attempt with two of these batteries, that is, no set of $n$ batteries is \"pairwise untested\". Indeed, if there is a set $S$ of $n$ pairwise untested batteries, you can be unlucky enough: the working batteries might be these in $S$. Conversely, if every set of $n$ batteries has two tested batteries, we will choose at some moment two charged batteries and the radio will work.\n\nSo consider a graph $G$ in which each battery is a vertex and we connect two batteries iff we **do not** test these batteries. The number of attempts is the number of disconnected pairs, that is $(2^n) - |E|$, where $E$ is the set of edges of $G$. Since we want to minimize the number of attempts, we must maximize $|E|$, that is, we need to have the maximum number of edges. But the only restriction is that we don't have a set S of n pairwise untested batteries, which speaking \"graph-wise\", is the same as G not having a n-clique. But, by Túran's Theorem, the graph with the maximum number of edges without a n-clique is the most balanced (n - 1)-partite graph. In this case, the partition sets of vertices of G must contain 3, 3, 2, 2, ..., 2 vertices (where we have n - 3 twos). So the least number of attempts is the number of disconnected pairs of vertices, that is, 2 \\cdot 3 + (n - 3) = n + 3.",

The lines AM, BN e CP concur on the Fermat point of ABC.\n\n*Proof.* Let $F$ be the intersection point of $BN$ and $CP$. Since triangles $BAN$ and $PAC$ are congruent, $\\angle APE = \\angle ABF$. So the quadrilateral $APBF$ is cyclic, and thus $\\angle AEP = \\angle ABP = 60^\\circ$ and $\\angle BFP = \\angle BAP = 60^\\circ$. Hence $\\angle AFB = \\angle BFC = 120^\\circ$, which proves that $F$ is the Fermat point of triangle $ABC$. Analogously, $AM$ and $BN$ pass through the same point $F$, and the lemma is proved.\n\nNow, let $O_A, O_B$ and $O_C$ the centers of these equilateral triangles (and also the circumcenters of triangles $BCF$, $ACF$ and $ABF$, respectively); $G_A, G_B$ and $G_C$ are the centroids of $BCF$, $ACF$ and $ABF$, respectively. It is immediate that the Euler lines of $O_A G_A, O_B G_B$ are $O_C G_C$ are parallel to $AF, BF$ and $CF$, respectively.\n\nNow consider the homothety with center $F$ and ratio $3/2$, which transforms $G_A, G_B$ and $G_C$ in the midpoints of $BC, CA$ and $AB$, respectively. This homothety also transform the Euler lines of $BCF, ACF$ and $ABF$ in the lines $l_A, l_B$ and $l_C$, paralell to $AF, BF$ and $CF$ and passing through the midpoints of $BC, CA$ and $AB$, respectively. Hence these Euler lines are concurrent iff $l_A, l_B$ and $l_C$ are.\n\nFinally, consider the homothety with center $G$ (centroid of $ABC$) and ratio $-2$. The midpoints of $BC, CA$ and $AB$ are transformed in the vertices $A, B$ and $C$, respectively, so $l_A, l_B$ and $l_C$ are transformed in $AF, BF$ and $CF$, respectively. Since the latter are concurrent at $F$, it follows that $l_A, l_B$ and $l_C$ are too, and we are done.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/Brazil_2006_p2_data_cdb3bb6621.png)",

Since $3240 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^4 \\cdot 5$, the only primes that can divide $p_2^2 + 1$ are 2 and 5.

Since $p_2$ and $p_3$ are primes, the optimal values for $x$ and $y$ are $x=2$ and $y=135$, that is, $p_2 = 3$ and $p_3 = 269$, leading to the minimal solution $n = 1614$.\n\n(c.2) All primes $p_i$ are odd.

So $f(n) = n+r$ is the sum of the Fibonacci numbers used in the representation of $n$ and its respective antecessors in the Fibonacci sequence, resulting in the subsequent Fibonacci numbers, which is exactly $n$ with a zero at its right. If the last digit of the Fibonacci of $n$ is zero, then $r$ is still obtained by deleting the last digit from $n$, but $f(n) = n+1+r$. Note that $n-1$ ends with a zero, so summing $r$ will do the same thing as the preceding case; and we're substituting the rightmost digit one with 2, which corresponds to a rightmost 10.\n\nNow, express $n$ and $f(n)$ by using the closed form for Fibonacci numbers $F_k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}(\\phi^k - (-\\phi)^{-k})$, and note that we cannot use two consecutive Fibonacci numbers in base Fibonacci, so $|f(n) - \\phi \\cdot nZ| < \\phi^{-1}(1 + \\phi^{-2} + \\phi^{-4} + \\dots) = \\frac{\\phi^{-1}}{1-\\phi^{-2}} = 1$, that is, $f(n) - 1 < \\phi n < f(n) + 1$. Thus if $m \\le \\phi n$ then $m < f(n) + 1 \\iff m \\le f(n)$ and the match is tough; if $m \\ge \\phi n + 1$ then $m > f(n) - 1 + 1 = f(n)$ and the match is not tough.\n\n*Remark.* One can prove (by induction on $n$) that $f(n) = \\lfloor(n+1)\\phi\\rfloor - 1$."

So there exists a rotation $\\sigma$ around the z-axis that maps $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ to the point $Q = (x_0 + az_1, y_0 + bz_1, z_1)$ from $\\ell$. So $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ can be obtained by applying the inverse rotation $\\sigma^{-1}$ to $\\ell$. Note that $\\sigma$ is unique, so only one of the rotated lines passes through $Q$.\n\nNow we can solve the problem. In this case, since the hyperboloid has equation $3x^2 + 3y^2 - z^2 - 1 = 0 \\iff x^2 + y^2 - \\frac{1}{3}z^2 = \\frac{1}{3}$ we can use $(x_0, y_0, 0) = (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}, 0, 0)$ and $(a, b, 1) = (0, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}, 1)$.\n\n(a) Since $(-a, -b, 1) = (0, -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}, 1)$, which is not parallel to $(a, b, 1)$, is also perpendicular to $(x_0, y_0, 0)$, the hyperboloid can be obtained rotating either the line $\\ell_1: (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}, 0, 0) + t(0, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}, 1)$ or $\\ell_2: (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}, 0, 0) + t(0, -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}, 1)$. So each point from $H$ belongs to at least two lines. We will prove that there are no other lines by showing that $H$ does not contain a line that is neither parallel to $(0, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}, 1)$ nor $(0, -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}, 1)$. Suppose it does. Since the sections of $H$ by horizontal planes are circles, this new line is not parallel to the xy-plane. So it contains a point in this plane, which we can suppose, without loss of generality, that is $(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}, 0, 0)$.\n\nSo suppose the line $r: (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}, 0, 0) + t(c, d, 1)$ is contained in $H$.

The case $m \\ge 3$ follows in a similar fashion, dividing the table into smaller subtables:\n\n% IMAGE: <table><tr><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>6</td></tr></table>\n\n% IMAGE: <table><tr><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>6</td><td>5</td></tr></table>\n\n% IMAGE: <table><tr><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>A</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr></table>\n\n% IMAGE: <table><tr><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>6</td><td>A</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr></table>\n\nThose tables prove that Bernold has winning strategy for tables $3 \\times n$, $n$ even and Arnold has winning strategy for tables $3 \\times n$, $n$ odd: divide the table into one $3 \\times 3$ or $3 \\times 5$ subtable and several $3 \\times 4$ subtables; it suffices to place the knight on the cell marked with an $A$ and then use the aforementioned Bernold's strategy.\n\nThe case $m = 4$ can be verified using several $4 \\times 2$ subtables if $n$ is even and one $4 \\times 3$ subtable and several $4 \\times 2$ subtables if $n$ is odd. This also proves that if either Arnold or Bernold has winning strategy for a $m \\times n$ table then he also has winning strategy for a $(m+4) \\times n$ table, $m \\ge 3$. So it suffices to solve the problem for $m \\in \\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\n\nThe case $m = 5$ can be solved using the following subtables:\n\n% IMAGE: <table><tr><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>9</td><td>6</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>13</td><td>14</td><td>15</td><td>7</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>12</td><td>13</td><td>14</td><td>15</td></tr></table>\n\n% IMAGE: <table><tr><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>10</td><td>8</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>A</td><td>12</td><td>7</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>9</td><td>8</td></tr></table>"

It's immediate that $n$ is odd. Since $1^2 \\equiv 3^2 \\equiv 5^2 \\equiv 7^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$, we must have $n \\equiv 7 \\pmod 8$ and $-k$ odd. Now look at it mod 16: let $k = -m$ and $n = 8u - 1$. Then\n\n\\[\n(8u - 1)^m \\equiv -1 + 8um \\pmod{16}\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*} \nn^m &\\equiv -9 \\pmod{16} & 8um - 1 &\\equiv -9 \\pmod{16} \\\\ \n&\\iff um \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}, \n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nthat is, $u$ is odd. Therefore $n = 8(2t + 1) - 1 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{16}$.\n\nNow look at $n^{-k} \\bmod 5$: since $-k$ is odd, and $1^3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 5$, $2^3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 5$, $3^3 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 5$ and $4^3 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 5$, we must have $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 5$. Putting everything together, we have $n \\equiv 7 \\pmod{16}$ and $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 5 \\implies n \\equiv 71 \\pmod{80}$, and thus $n \\ge 71$.\n\nWe claim that $n = 71$ does the job. First notice that, by the Lifting the Exponent lemma, $\\nu_2(71^N - 1) = \\nu_2(71^2 - 1) + \\nu_2(N) - 1 = \\nu_2(N) + 3$ and $\\nu_5(71^N - 1) = \\nu_5(71 - 1) + \\nu_5(N) = \\nu_5(N) + 1$.\n\nNow, notice that this implies $71^v \\equiv 71^w \\pmod{2^t}$ $\\iff 71^{v-w} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^t}$ $\\iff \\nu_2(v-w) + 3 \\ge t \\iff 2^{t-3} \\mid v-w \\iff v \\equiv w \\pmod{2^{t-3}}$. We analyze now the possible residues of $71^N \\pmod{2^t}$: first, we know that $71 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{16}$, and $71^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$, so all residues $71^N \\pmod{2^t}$ are congruent to either 1 or $7 \\pmod{16}$, so one eighth of the residues appear, in a total of $2^{t-3}$ residues. But $71^v \\equiv 71^w \\pmod{2^t}$ $\\iff v \\equiv w \\pmod{2^{t-3}}$, so there are at most $2^{t-3}$ residues. This means that the residues are all numbers congruent to 1 or $7 \\pmod{16}$. So, for all $t \\ge 4$ there is $N$ such that $71^N \\equiv -9 \\pmod{2^t}$. Notice that $N$ is unique mod $2^{t-3}$.\n\nThe same argument applies mod $5^t$: all residues of $71^N \\pmod{5^t}$ are congruent to $1 \\pmod 5$ and $71^v \\equiv 71^w \\pmod{5^t} \\iff 71^{v-w} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5^t} \\iff \\nu_5(v-w) + 1 \\ge t \\iff 5^{t-1} \\mid v-w \\iff v \\equiv w \\pmod{5^{t-1}}$. One fifth of the residues appear, all of them congruent to 1 mod 5. So the residues are\n\nall numbers congruent to 1 mod 5, and for all $t \\ge 2$ there is $N$ such that $71^N \\equiv -9 \\pmod{5^t}$. Notice that $N$ is unique mod $5^{t-1}$.\n\nWe can finish the problem now: we only need to find $N$ that is congruent to a number mod $2^t$ and to a number mod $5^t$, but it exists due to the Chinese remainder theorem. Now plug $t = 2012$.",

Thus we have an infinity of possible semicircles through $P$.\n\nAn exactly similar argument works for $P$ outside $L$.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/obm-book_p73_data_64e41fff0b.png)\n\nFor the third case, just take the center sufficiently far from $P$ on the same side of $L$ as $P$.\n\nOn to the second part. Step 1 is to show that if we fix $C$ and allow $B$ to vary along a line $l$, then $\\angle x$ increases as $B$ moves down ($O$ is confined to the line and $OB = OC$). In fact, if $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$ then $M$ belongs to the line parallel to $l$ and pass through a point whose distance to $l$ is half the distance from $C$ to $l$. Moreover, the quadrilateral $OPBM$ is cyclic, so $\\angle OBM = \\angle OPM$, and $\\angle OPM$ decreases as $B$ moves down. This means that $\\angle x = 90^\\circ - \\angle OPM$ increases as $B$ moves down.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/obm-book_p73_data_1d8f261bca.png)\n\nStep 2 is to show that $\\angle b + \\angle c + \\angle x = 180^\\circ$. Let the tangents to the arc passing through $B$ and $C$ intersect in $D$. So $\\angle BDC = \\angle b + \\angle c$ and, by looking at the internal angles of the quadrilateral $OBDC$, $\\angle x + 90^\\circ + 90^\\circ + \\angle b + \\angle c =$\n\n$$\n360^{\\circ} \\iff \\angle b + \\angle c + \\angle x = 180^{\\circ}.\n$$\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/obm-book_p74_data_070b3e4c3c.png)\n\nNow consider the special case where AB is a straight line. Using the previous results one can show by some angle chasing that the sum of the angles in the triangle is $180^{\\circ} - (\\angle O' - \\angle O) < 180^{\\circ}$. Finally, use this special case to deduce the other cases (by dividing the general triangle into two parts which fall into the special case).\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/obm-book_p74_data_1467089a63.png)",

Combining these two facts and other arguments will lead us to a solution.\n\nThe first step is proving that if *R* and *r* are the circumradius and the inradius of the circumscribed and inscribed spheres of a tetrahedron *T* then *R* \\ge 3*r*.\nTo do this, consider the tetrahedron *T*' whose vertices are the centroids of the faces of *T*. Then *T'* is similar to *T*, with ratio 1 : 3 (the faces of *T*' are parallel to the faces of *T* and the ratio of the altitudes is 1 : 3). The circumradius of *T'*, which is $\\frac{R}{3}$, must be bigger than *r*, because the smallest sphere through four points, one in each face of *T*, is the inscribed sphere. So $R \\ge 3r$.\n\nNow we prove that if *ABC* is not obtusangle and has all sides smaller than the side *l* of an equilateral triangle then the circumradius *R* of *ABC* is less than the circumradius *R'* of the equilateral triangle. Indeed, by the sine law, if *a* is the greater side of *ABC* then $60^{\\circ} \\le \\angle A \\le 90^{\\circ}$ and $2R = \\frac{a}{\\sin \\angle A} < \\frac{l}{\\sin 60^{\\circ}} = 2R'$. Let *T* be a tetrahedron and *U* be the regular tetrahedron with edge length *a* and same circumradius *R* as *T*.

For $k = 0$ and $k = 1$, one may consider $r_0(n) = 0$ and $r_1(n) = n$. For $k \\ge 2$, let's find a polynomial\n\n$$\nr(n) = n^k + r_{k-1} n^{k-1} + \\cdots + r_1 n + r_0\n$$\n\nsuch that $n(r(n+2) - r(n+1)) = kr(n)$ for all $n$.\n\nExpanding $(n + 2)^i$ and $(n + 1)^i$ via binomial theorem, we obtain the system of equations\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n& 3 \\binom{k}{k-2} + \\binom{k-1}{k-2} r_{k-1} = k r_{k-1} \\\\\n& 7 \\binom{k}{k-3} + 3 \\binom{k-1}{k-3} r_{k-1} + \\binom{k-2}{k-3} r_{k-2} = k r_{k-2} \\\\\n& \\qquad \\dots \\\\\n& (2^j - 1) \\binom{k}{k-j} + (2^{j-1} - 1) \\binom{k-1}{k-j} r_{k-1} + \\dots + \\binom{k-j+1}{k-j} r_{k-j+1} = k r_{k-j+1} \\\\\n& \\qquad \\dots\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSince $\\binom{k-j+1}{k-j} = k-j+1 \\neq k$ it is possible to find $r_{k-j+1}$ in each equation and\nthe system is possible, so there is such a polynomial.\n\nFor the second part, rewrite the given equation as $n(\\frac{a_{n+2}}{a_{n+1}} - 1) = k \\frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}}$. If there exists polynomials $p$ and $q$ such that $\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = \\frac{p(n)}{q(n)}$, then\n\n$$\nn \\left( \\frac{p(n+1)}{q(n+1)} - 1 \\right) = k \\frac{q(n)}{p(n)} \\iff n(p(n+1) - q(n+1))p(n) = kq(n+1)q(n)\n$$\n\nWe may suppose without loss of generality that $p(n)$ and $q(n)$ don't have common factors. Let $m$ and $m'$ be the degrees of $p$ and $q$, respectively. If $m = m'$ then the right hand side has degree $2m$ and the degree of $p(n+1) - q(n+1)$ is $m-1$. This means that the leading coefficients of $p$ and $q$ are equal. Since $p(n)$ and $q(n)$ don't have common factors, $p(n)$ divides $q(n+1)$, which in this case means $p(n) = q(n+1)$. Substituting yields $n(q(n+2) - q(n+1)) = kq(n)$, and $q$ satisfies the first part of the problem, and thus $k$ must be a nonnegative integer.\n\nIf $m \\neq m'$ by checking degrees we must have $1 + \\text{máx}(m, m') + m = 2m' \\Rightarrow 2m' \\le 1 + m + m' \\iff m < m' \\Rightarrow 1 + m' + m = 2m' \\iff m' = m + 1$. The polynomials $q(n+1)$ and $p(n+1) - q(n+1)$ don't have common factors, so $q(n)$ divides $p(n+1) - q(n+1)$. These two polynomials have both degree $m'$ and opposite leading coefficients, so $p(n+1) = q(n+1) - q(n)$. Substituting yields the polynomial identity $n(q(n) - q(n-1)) = -kq(n+1)$. Now if $r(n) = q(1-n)$ and $m = -n$ then $n(r(m+2) - r(m+1)) = -kr(m)$ and we reduce the problem to the first part again for $-k$ instead of $k$. So, in this case, $k$ must be a nonpositive integer.\n\nConversely, it's not hard to obtain $p(n)$ and $q(n)$ from the above case, so the answer for the second part is $k$ integer.",

Indeed, if there is a set $S$ of $n$ pairwise untested batteries, you can be unlucky enough: the working batteries might be these in $S$. Conversely, if every set of $n$ batteries has two tested batteries, we will choose at some moment two charged batteries and the radio will work.\n\nSo consider a graph $G$ in which each battery is a vertex and we connect two batteries iff we \\textbf{do not} test these batteries. The number of attempts is the number of disconnected pairs, that is $\\binom{2n}{2} - |E|$, where $E$ is the set of edges of $G$. Since we want to minimize the number of attempts, we must maximize $|E|$, that is, we need to have the maximum number of edges. But the only restriction is that we don't have a set $S$ of $n$ pairwise untested batteries, which speaking \"graph-wise\", is the same as $G$ not having a $n$-clique. But, by Túran's Theorem, the graph with the maximum number of edges without a $n$-clique is the most balanced $(n-1)$-partite graph. In this case, the partition sets of vertices of $G$ must contain 3, 3, 2, 2, ..., 2 vertices (where we have $n-3$ twos). So the least number of attempts is the number of disconnected pairs of vertices, that is, $2 \\cdot 3 + (n-3) = n + 3$.",

The proof goes by induction: it is true for $n = 0$. Suppose $n > 0$. Note that, by the induction hyposthesis, in the definition of $f(n)$, $r$ will be such that $f(r) = n$, if the last digit of the Fibonacci of $n$ is zero, or $f(r) = n-1$, if it is one. Furthermore, $r$ is obtained by deleting the last digit from $n$. Recall that $f(n) = n + r + n - f(r)$. Therefore, if the last digit of the Fibonacci representation of $n$ is zero, $f(n) = n + r$, which is the sum of the Fibonacci numbers used in the representation of $n$ and its respective antecessors in the Fibonacci sequence, resulting in the subsequent Fibonacci numbers, which is exactly $n$ with one additional zero at its right. And, if the last digit of the Fibonacci of $n$ is one, $f(n) = n + 1 + r$. In this case, note that $n-1$ ends with a zero, then the previous argument applies: the representation of $n-1+r$ is equal to that of $n-1$ with a 0 added to the right. To get $f(n)$ we still need to add 2, which corresponds to replace the rightmost digits 00 to a rightmost 10.\n\nNow, express $n$ and $f(n)$ by using the well known closed form for Fibonacci numbers $F_k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}(\\phi^k - (-\\phi)^{-k})$, and remember that we cannot use two consecutive Fibonacci numbers in base Fibonacci, so $|f(n) - \\phi \\cdot n| < \\phi^{-1}(1 + \\phi^{-2} + \\phi^{-4} + \\dots) = \\frac{\\phi^{-1}}{1-\\phi^{-2}} = 1$, that is, $f(n) - 1 < \\phi n < f(n) + 1$.

For $n > 2$ we count all odd quadratic residues modulo $2^n$: let $x$ and $y$ be odd numbers; then $x - y$ and $x + y$ are even but not both divisible by 4, that is, one of the integer numbers $\\frac{x-y}{2}$ and $\\frac{x+y}{2}$ is odd. Hence $x^2 \\equiv y^2 \\pmod{2^n} \\iff 2^n \\mid (x-y)(x+y) \\iff 2^{n-2} \\mid (\\frac{x-y}{2})^2 \\pmod{2^n} \\iff 2^{n-2} \\mid \\frac{x+y}{2} \\text{ or } 2^{n-2} \\mid \\frac{x-y}{2} \\iff x \\equiv \\pm y \\pmod{2^{n-1}} \\iff x \\equiv \\pm y \\pmod{2^n} \\text{ or } x \\equiv \\pm y + 2^{n-1} \\pmod{2^n}$. This means that each odd quadratic residue is generated by 4 odd numbers between 1 and $2^n - 1$. Thus there are $\\frac{2^{n-1}}{4} = 2^{n-3}$ odd quadratic residues. Since there are also $2^{n-3}$ numbers congruent to 1 modulo 8, all these numbers are the odd quadratic residues modulo $2^n$.\n\nNow let's focus on even quadratic residues. Let $c = 2^m\\ell$, $m$ positive integer, $m < 2007$, $\\ell$ odd. Then $x^2 \\equiv c \\pmod{2^{2007}} \\iff x^2 = 2^m\\ell + 2^{2007}k = 2^m(\\ell + 2^{2007-m}k)$. Since $\\ell + 2^{2007-m}k$ is odd, $m$ must be even and $\\ell$ must be an odd quadratic residue modulo $2^{2007-m}$, which implies $\\ell \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$. So the even quadratic residue are of the form $2^{2u}\\ell$, $\\ell \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$.\n\nWe are ready to count all the quadratic residues in $l$: $\\frac{2001-(-2007)}{8} + 1 = 502$ are odd; $\\frac{4 \\cdot 497 - 4 \\cdot (-495)}{4 \\cdot 8} + 1 = 125$ are of the form $2^2 \\cdot \\ell$; $\\frac{16 \\cdot 121 - 16 \\cdot (-119)}{16 \\cdot 8} + 1 = 31$ are of the form $2^4 \\cdot \\ell$; $\\frac{64 \\cdot 25 - 64 \\cdot (-31)}{64 \\cdot 8} + 1 = 8$ are of the form $2^6 \\cdot \\ell$; 256 and"

We'll show that $A \\ge -\\frac{1}{2}$, proving that $-\\frac{1}{2}$ is indeed the minimum value required. The following properties of $f$ are useful:\n\n(i) $|f(t)| \\le \\frac{1}{2}$ for any real number $t$.
