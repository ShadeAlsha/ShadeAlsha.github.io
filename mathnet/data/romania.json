First, perform a horizontal translation of each slice $K \\cap (\\mathbb{R} \\times y)$ to place it symmetrically about the vertical line $x = \\frac{1}{2}$. It is readily checked that the image $K'$ of $K$ under this transformation is a closed convex subset of the open square $(1/2 - n/2, 1/2 + n/2) \\times (0, n)$, symmetrical about the vertical line $x = 1/2$, and area $K' = \\text{area } K \\ge n$. (Also, the transformation does not increase perimeters, a fact which will not be used in the sequel.) In addition, if $K$ contains no lattice point, so does $K'$. Indeed, if $K'$ contained one such, say $i \\times j$, then the line $y = j$ would intersect $K'$ in a closed line segment of length at least 1, so it would also intersect $K$ in a closed line segment of the same length; the latter, in turn, would contain at least one lattice point – a contradiction.\n\nNext, apply the pattern vertically to further symmetrize $K'$ about the horizontal line $y = 1/2$. The resulting image $K''$ is a closed convex subset of the open square $(1/2 - n/2, 1/2 + n/2) \\times (1/2 - n/2, 1/2 + n/2)$, symmetrical about both lines $x = 1/2$ and $y = 1/2$ – whence centrally symmetric about the point $1/2 \\times 1/2$ – and of course area $K'' = \\text{area } K' = \\text{area } K \\ge n$. Then if $K$ contains no lattice point, so does $K''$.\n\nNow let $a = \\sup\\{x : x \\times 1/2 \\in K''\\}$ and $b = \\sup\\{y : 1/2 \\times y \\in K''\\}$ and notice that $a - 1/2 < n/2$ and $b - 1/2 < n/2$ – both inequalities are strict, for $K''$ is closed. Let further $K_0 = K'' \\cap \\{x \\times y : x \\ge 1/2 \\text{ and } y \\ge 1/2\\}$ be the upper right quarter of $K''$. Clearly, $K_0$ is a closed convex set, and area $K_0 = (\\text{area } K'')/4 \\ge n/4$. Suppose, if possible, that $K$ contains no lattice point. Then so does $K_0$, so by convexity it must\n\nlie below some line through the lattice point $1 \\times 1$ with a non-positive slope; that is,\n\n$$\nK_0 \\subset H = \\{x \\times y : \\alpha(x - 1) + \\beta(y - 1) < 0\\},\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are non-negative real numbers such that $\\alpha + \\beta > 0$. Notice that $K_0 \\subset H \\cap ([1/2, a] \\times [1/2, b])$, so $\\max\\{a, b\\} > 3/2$, for otherwise\n\n$$\n1/2 \\le n/4 \\le \\text{area } K_0 < \\text{area} (H \\cap ([1/2, 3/2] \\times [1/2, 3/2])) = 1/2,\n$$\n\nwhich is a contradiction – the strict inequality above is due to the fact that $K_0$ is closed. Without loss of generality, assume that $a > 3/2$, so $\\beta \\ne 0$ and\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} \\text{area } K_0 < \\text{area} (H \\cap ([1/2, a] \\times [1/2, \\infty))) \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{2} \\left(a - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta} \\left(a - \\frac{3}{2}\\right)\\right) \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\left(a - \\frac{1}{2}\\right); \\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nas before, the inequality is strict because $K_0$ is closed. Finally, recall that $a - 1/2 < n/2$ and area $K_0 \\ge n/4$ to derive a contradiction.\n\n### REMARKS.\n\n(1) The argument applies mutatis-mutandis to show that an open convex set of area greater than $n$, contained in the open square $(0, n) \\times (0, n)$, contains some lattice point. By a similar but more careful argument, it can be shown that an open convex set in the plane whose area is greater than half its perimeter, contains some lattice point.^2\n\n(2) The condition on the area of $K$ is essential for the conclusion to hold. Given any positive $\\varepsilon$, there exist closed convex sets $K \\subset (0, n) \\times (0, n)$ such that $n - \\varepsilon < \\text{area } K < n$, which contain no lattice point – for a suitable positive $\\delta$, the set $K = [\\delta, n - \\delta] \\times [\\delta, 1 - \\delta]$ is one such. Similarly, $K = (0, n) \\times (0, 1) \\subset (0, n) \\times (0, n)$ is an open convex set of area $n$, which contains no lattice point.",

Let $\\mathcal{D}_0 = \\mathcal{D}_0(\\mathcal{L})$ denote the set of the discs we are to count. Clearly, each disc in $\\mathcal{D}_0$ is contained in some bounded room. We shall prove that each bounded contains exactly one such, whence the conclusion. To this end, we shall first prove that no bounded room contains more than one disc in $\\mathcal{D}_0$, and then that each bounded room contains at least one such.\n\nSuppose, if possible, that $R$ is a bounded room which contains two discs in $\\mathcal{D}_0$; one, of radius $r$, centerd at $\\omega$, inscribed in the triangle $abc$ enclosed by the lines $a, b$ and $c$ in $\\mathcal{L}$; and another, of radius $r'$, centerd at $\\omega'$, inscribed in the triangle $a'b'c'$ enclosed by the lines $a', b'$ and $c'$ in $\\mathcal{L}$. Clearly, the lines $a, b, c, a', b'$ and $c'$ support edges on the boundary of $R$, the triangles $abc$ and $a'b'c'$ both contain $R$, and $\\omega$ and $\\omega'$ are distinct. Without loss of generality, we may assume that $r \\le r'$. Since $\\omega'$ lies in the interior of the triangle $abc$ and is different from $\\omega$, it is within $r \\le r'$ from one of the lines $a, b$ or $c$. Consequently, that line intersects the disc of radius $r'$ centerd at $\\omega' - a$ contradiction.\n\nWe now proceed to prove that each bounded room contains a disc in $\\mathcal{D}_0$. Since $R$ is convex, and no two lines in $\\mathcal{L}$ are parallel, among those lines in $\\mathcal{L}$ which support edges on the boundary of $R$, at least three enclose a triangle which contains $R$ – this is a well-known fact about convex polygons different from a parallelogram. Of all such triangles, choose one with a minimal inradius. We shall prove that the open circular disc $D$ inscribed in that triangle is contained in $R$; in particular, $D$ is in $\\mathcal{D}_0$. Let the triangle be enclosed by the lines $a, b$ and $c$ in $\\mathcal{L}$. Since each of the lines $a, b$ and $c$ supports an edge on the boundary of $R$, it follows that $D$ and $R$ are not disjoint. Suppose, if possible, that $D$ is not contained in $R$. Then $D$ contains points on some edge on the boundary of $R$. Let $d$ be a line in $\\mathcal{L}$ that supports such an edge. Clearly, $d$ is different from $a, b$ and $c$, and it is not hard to see that $d$ and two of the lines $a, b, c$ enclose a triangle which contains $R$ and has an inradius smaller than the radius of $D$ – a contradiction.",

Project $A$ orthogonally on another line $b$ which is parallel to $a$, and consider a three-element monochromatic subset $B$ of the image of $A$ under projection.

Back to the claim, suppose that $f(p) = q^m$ for some distinct primes $p$ and $q$ and some positive integer $m$.

So there exist $51 - k$ points with coordinates of different parity, again all distances among them being even integers.\n\nTherefore, at least $\\binom{k}{2} + \\binom{51-k}{2}$ distances are even numbers (by definition $\\binom{n}{k} = 0$ if $k > n$). Since there are $\\binom{51}{2}$ distances in all, one has\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\binom{k}{2} + \\binom{51-k}{2}}{\\binom{51}{2}} &= \\frac{k(k-1) + (51-k)(50-k)}{51 \\cdot 50} \\\\ &= 1 + \\frac{k^2 - 51k}{51 \\cdot 25} \\ge 1 - \\frac{51^2}{51 \\cdot 25} = 1 - \\frac{51}{100} = 49\\%. \\end{aligned}\n$$",

We deduce that $E' = A$, otherwise $A \\in (E'P)$ and through a translation we get that there exists a latticeal point lying on $PE$, contradiction. So in this case $\\frac{AP}{PE} = 1$.\n\nIf $E$ is not a latticeal point, and on ($BC$) lies some other latticeal point $Q$, since $Q \\neq E$ we can restrict the problem to either triangle $ABQ$ or $ACQ$, with the same initial hypothesis. Thus we can assume that the only latticeal points on the sides of the triangle are on $[AB]$ and $[AC]$.\n\nWe shall prove that, over all configurations,\n\n$$\n\\max \\frac{AP}{PE} = 5,\n$$\n\nvalue which can actually be reached by a proper configuration. Rather than looking for $\\max \\frac{AP}{PE}$, we will establish $\\min \\frac{PE}{AE} = \\min \\frac{[BPC]}{[ABC]}$ (where by $[XYZ]$ we mean the area of $\\triangle XYZ$).\n\nLet us notice that for the triangle $BPC$, the only latticeal points that are lying either on its sides, or in its interior, are just its vertices. We deduce from Pick's Theorem that $[BPC] = \\frac{1}{2}$. Let us denote by $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ the number of latticeal points on the sides ($AB$), respectively ($AC$). Availing ourselves again of Pick's Theorem, we find that $[ABC] = \\frac{\\beta + \\gamma + 3}{2}$.\n\nWe get that $\\frac{PE}{AE} = \\frac{1}{\\beta + \\gamma + 3}$. We want to prove that $\\frac{PE}{AE} \\ge \\frac{1}{6}$. We contrariwise assume $\\frac{PE}{AE} < \\frac{1}{6}$, and thus $\\beta + \\gamma \\ge 4$.\n\nDenote by $B_0, B_1, \\dots, B_{\\beta+1}$ the lattice points on $[AB]$, with $B_0 = A$, $B_{\\beta+1} = B$, and by $C_0, C_1, \\dots, C_{\\gamma+1}$ the lattice points on $[AC]$, with $C_0 = A$, $C_{\\gamma+1} = C$.\n\nLet us consider the triangles of the type $PC_iC_{i+1}$ with $i = 0, \\dots, \\gamma$. They share the property that no lattice points lie inside or on the sides, other than the vertices, so $[PC_iC_{i+1}] = \\frac{1}{2}$. It follows that $AC_1 = C_1C_2 = \\dots = C_\\gamma C$. With a similar reasoning we have also $AB_1 = B_1B_2 = \\dots = B_\\beta B$. Thus $\\frac{AC_j}{C_jC_{j+1}} = \\frac{AB_j}{B_jB_{j+1}}$, and so $C_iB_i \\parallel C_{i+1}B_{i+1}$, for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, \\min\\{\\beta, \\gamma\\}\\}$.\n\nWe also deduce that on the segment $(B_iC_i)$ lie $i-1$ lattice points. This is because we can construct $i-1$ parallelograms with vertices of the type $B_lC_lB_iD$ with $l < i$, or of the type $B_lC_lC_iD$ with $D \\in (B_iC_i)$. From effectively writing the relationships between coordinates in a parallelogram, we get that $D$ is a lattice point. Thus if $\\min\\{\\beta, \\gamma\\} \\ge 2$, the segments $(B_i, C_i)$ would contain at least three lattice points (the ones from $(B_2C_2)$ and $(B_3C_3)$), which is obviously false since $P$ is on at most one of the segments $(B_iC_i)$. This means $\\min\\{\\beta, \\gamma\\} \\le 1$, with say $\\beta \\ge \\gamma$.\n\n**First case.** $\\gamma = 1$. From $\\beta + \\gamma \\ge 4$ follows that $\\beta \\ge 3$ and that $C_1$ is the midpoint of $AC$. Now since $B_1$ is the midpoint of $AB_2$ we have that if we take $M$ the midpoint of $CB_2$, we get the parallelogram $B_2B_1C_1M$, and since all the points $B_2, B_1, C_1$ are lattice, we get $M$ lattice. Since $M$ is inside the triangle $ABC$, it must be $P$. The quadrilateral $BB_\\beta PC$ is convex since $B_\\beta \\in (B_2B)$. We note that the triangles $BB_\\beta C$ and $BB_\\beta P$ have the property that there are no lattice points inside or on their sides, except their vertices, so $[BB_\\beta P] = [BB_\\beta C] = \\frac{1}{2}$, hence $BB_\\beta \\parallel PC$, which is false.\n\n**Second case.** $\\gamma = 0$. It follows that $\\beta \\ge 4$.\n\n**LEMMA.** Let $XYZT$ be a convex quadrilateral with lattice vertices, with the property that no lattice points lie in its interior, nor on its sides, except for its vertices. Then $XYZT$ is a parallelogram.\n\n*Proof.* From Pick's theorem we know that $[XYZ] = [XYT] = \\frac{1}{2}$, and so $XY \\parallel ZT$. Similarly $XT \\parallel YZ$, which ends the proof. $\\square$\n\nLet us consider the quadrilateral $AB_1PC$, with $AB_1 \\cap PC \\ne \\emptyset$. If it is convex, the previous LEMMA implies a contradiction. Thus $[AB_1] \\cap PC \\ne \\emptyset$. Also consider the quadrilateral $BB_\\beta PC$. By the same reasoning, we must have $[BB_\\beta] \\cap PC \\ne \\emptyset$. This is the desired contradiction and ends the solution of the problem.",

Then the set $\\{a + i; i = 1, 2, \\dots, k\\}$ of $k$ consecutive integers has the desired property, hence $m(P) \\ge k$. When $\\min P > |P|$, within any set of $|P| + 1$ consecutive integers at most one is divisible by any $p \\in P$, hence by the Pigeonhole Principle there will be one not divisible by any of the primes in $P$. On the other hand, when $\\min P \\le |P|$, we will make again use of the Chinese Remainder Theorem, so there will exist some $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $a \\equiv -r_i \\pmod{p_i}$, hence $p_i \\mid a+r_i$, where $\\{r_i; i = 1, 2, \\dots, k\\} = \\{1, 2, \\dots, k\\}$ and the extra requirement that $r_1 = k+1-p_1$. It follows that the set $\\{a+i; i = 1, 2, \\dots, k, k+1\\}$ of $k+1$ consecutive integers has the desired property, hence $m(P) \\ge k+1 > |P|$.\n\n(ii) Now, let a set made of $m$ consecutive integers have the desired property. For any $\\emptyset \\ne I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, \\dots, k\\}$, the number $N(I)$ of its elements which are divisible by $\\prod_{i \\in I} p_i$ will satisfy the inequality\n\n\\[\n\\frac{m}{\\prod_{i \\in I} p_i} - 1 < \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{\\prod_{i \\in I} p_i} \\right\\rfloor \\le N(I) \\le \\left\\lceil \\frac{m}{\\prod_{i \\in I} p_i} \\right\\rceil < \\frac{m}{\\prod_{i \\in I} p_i} + 1.\n\\]\n\nThen, by the Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion, one has\n\n\\[\nm = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} (-1)^{i+1} \\sum_{|I|=i} N(I) < \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\binom{k}{i} + m \\sum_{i=1}^{k} (-1)^{i+1} \\sum_{|I|=i} \\frac{1}{\\prod_{i \\in I} p_i}.\n\\]\n\nThe first term is clearly equal to $2^k - 1$, while the second is equal to\n\n\\[\nm \\left( 1 - \\prod_{i=1}^{k} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{p_i} \\right) \\right) \\le m \\left( 1 - \\prod_{i=1}^{k} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{i+1} \\right) \\right) = m - \\frac{m}{k+1},\n\\]\n\ntherefore $m < (k+1)(2^k - 1)$, and so will be $m(P)$.\n\n*Alternative Solution* (ii). (F. Chindea) Not only an elegant alternative approach, but vastly improving on the required bound. Start by proving the following\n\nLEMMA. If the integer arithmetic sequences $\\{mn_j\\}_{m \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$, $1 \\le j \\le k$, are such that they cover $2^k$ consecutive integers, then they cover $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n(Particular case of a Crittenden & Vanden Eynden Theorem)\n\n$\\frac{2\\pi i}{|S|}$\n\n*Proof.* Let $\\omega_j = e^{n_j}$ be a primitive root of unity. Then $n_j \\mid m$ if and only if $\\omega_j^m = 1$, hence $m$ is divisible by at least one $n_j$ if and only if $0 = \\prod_{j=1}^k (1 - \\omega_j^m) = \\sum_{\\emptyset \\subseteq S \\subseteq [k]} (-1)^{|S|} e^{2m\\pi i \\sum_{j \\in S} \\frac{1}{n_j}}$. Denote $\\alpha_S = (-1)^{|S|}$, $z_S = e^{2\\pi i \\sum_{j \\in S} \\frac{1}{n_j}}$, $u_m = \\sum_{\\emptyset \\subseteq S \\subseteq [k]} \\alpha_S z_S^m$.\n\nConsider the polynomial $f(x) = \\prod_{\\emptyset \\subseteq S \\subseteq [k]} (x - z_S) = \\sum_{j=0}^{2^k} c_j x^j$, of degree $\\deg f = 2^k$, and with $c_{2^k} = 1$, $|c_0| = \\prod_{\\emptyset \\subseteq S \\subseteq [k]} |z_S| = 1$. Then $\\alpha_S z_S^b f(z_S) = 0$ for any integer $b$, hence\n\n\\[\n0 = \\sum_{\\emptyset \\subseteq S \\subseteq [k]} \\alpha_S z_S^b f(z_S) = \\sum_{j=0}^{2^k} c_j \\sum_{\\emptyset \\subseteq S \\subseteq [k]} \\alpha_S z_S^{b+j} = \\sum_{j=0}^{2^k} c_j u_{b+j}.\n\\]\n\nAssume the $2^k$ consecutive integers $a+1, \\dots, a+2^k$ are covered, so, according with the above, $u_{a+1} = \\dots = u_{a+2^k} = 0$. Since $c_0 \\neq 0$ and $c_{2^k} \\neq 0$, by simple induction one gets $u_b = 0$ for any integer $b$ (a linear recurrence relation of order $2^k$ containing $2^k$ consecutive null terms generates an all-null sequence). $\\square$\n\nNow, in our case, if we assume $m(P) \\ge 2^{|P|}$, then the $|P|$ arithmetic sequences given by $\\{mp\\}_{m \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$, $p \\in P$, will cover $2^k$ consecutive integers, hence they will cover $\\mathbb{Z}$. But clearly a large enough prime $q$ is not divisible by any $p \\in P$, so this is absurd, therefore $m(P) < 2^{|P|}$.\\textsuperscript{5}\n\n**REMARKS.** When the primes in $P$ are the first $|P|$ consecutive primes $q_1, q_2, \\dots, q_k$, it is easy to see that the set of integers between 1 and the next prime $q_{k+1}$ has the desired property, so $m(P) \\ge q_{k+1} - 2$. It is obvious that one can check just the positive integers less than $\\prod_{1 \\le i \\le k} q_i$ in order to verify that this is indeed the value of $m(P)$, and this conjecture seems to hold, since it is true for $k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$. However, for $k = 6$, there exists a larger set than (prescribed) between 1 and 13, made by the numbers between 113 and 127.",

A cute combinatorial model for $m=3$ is given by an equilateral triangle, partitioned in $n^2$ congruent equilateral triangles by $n-1$ equidistant parallels to each of its three sides. Two chess-like *bishops* placed at any two vertices of the small triangles are said to *menace* one another if they lie on a same parallel. For $m=3$, we want to determine the largest number of bishops that can be placed, so that none menaces another. It is readily seen that a bishop may be assigned three coordinates – the number(s) of sides of small triangles they are off each of the sides of the big triangle, and that the sum of these coordinates is always $n$, therefore fulfilling the requirements.",

Assigning to each vector $\\mathbf{v} = (x, y)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ the unit vector\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{u} = \\left( \\frac{2x}{x^2 + y^2 + 1}, \\frac{2y}{x^2 + y^2 + 1}, \\frac{x^2 + y^2 - 1}{x^2 + y^2 + 1} \\right)\n$$\n\nin $\\mathbb{R}^3$ defines a bijection between all vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and all unit vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ different from $(0, 0, 1)$; its inverse sends a unit vector $\\mathbf{u} = (x, y, z) \\neq (0, 0, 1)$ to the vector $\\mathbf{v} = (x/(1-z), y/(1-z))$. Clearly, the condition\n\n$$\n4 (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}') + (|\\mathbf{v}|^2 - 1)(|\\mathbf{v}'|^2 - 1) < 0\n$$\n\nfor vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is equivalent to $\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{u}' < 0$ for the corresponding unit vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Now let $S = \\{\\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}_2, \\dots, \\mathbf{v}_n\\}$, let $\\{\\mathbf{u}_1, \\mathbf{u}_2, \\dots, \\mathbf{u}_n\\}$ be the set of corresponding unit vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and consider the graph $G$ on $n$ vertices labelled $1, 2, \\dots, n$, with an edge joining vertex $i$ to vertex $j$ if and only if $\\mathbf{u}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{u}_j < 0$. Since the largest size of a set of vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with negative mutual dot-products is 4, it follows that $G$ is $K_5$-free. Hence, by Turán's theorem, $G$ has at most the following number of edges\n\n$$\n\\lfloor \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{5-1}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{n^2}{2} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 3n^2/8 \\rfloor,\n$$\n\nthe upper bound being achieved by Turán's extremal graph $T(n, 5) = K_{n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4}$, where $n_1 + n_2 + n_3 + n_4 = n$ and $|n_i - n_j| \\le 1$. Geometrically, this can be achieved in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ by considering four tight bundles of $n_i$ unit vectors each, around the vectors $(1, 0, 0)$, $(-1, 2, 0)$, $(-1, -1, 3)$ and $(-1, -1, -1)$, respectively. Consequently, the required maximum is $\\lfloor 3n^2/8 \\rfloor$.\n\nAlternatively, notice that no five vertices of the complement $\\bar{G}$ of $G$ are independent, so the independence number $\\alpha(\\bar{G}) \\le 4$, and apply the Caro-Wei theorem to get\n\n$$\n4 \\ge \\alpha(\\bar{G}) \\ge \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{1 + \\deg i} \\ge \\frac{n}{1 + \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\deg i} = \\frac{n^2}{n + 2|E(\\bar{G})|}.\n$$\n\nConsequently, $|E(\\bar{G})| \\ge n(n-4)/8$, so $|E(G)| = n(n-1)/2 - |E(\\bar{G})| \\le 3n^2/8$.\n\n% REMARKS.

We get $CD'_1 = CD = CD'_2$,\nwhile $\\angle ECD'_1 \\equiv \\angle ECB + \\angle BCD'_1 \\equiv\n\\angle ACD + \\angle BCD \\equiv \\angle ACB$, and similarly\n$\\angle ECD'_2 \\equiv \\angle ACB$, whence $\\Delta ECD'_1 \\equiv\n\\Delta ECD'_2$, so $ED'_1 = ED'_2$. In a similar way\nwe get $ED'_2 = ED'_3$, showing that $E$ is the\ncircumcenter of triangle $D'_1D'_2D'_3$. Let us\nconsider now the homothety of center $D$ and\n\nratio $\\frac{1}{2}$.

Notice we may apply the above LEMMA to points $C_1$ and $O$, isogonal conjugate with respect to triangle $ACT$.

Since any pair of them can lie on at most two blue-centerd unit circles, it means that the number $b$ of blue points can be at most $2\\binom{r}{2} = r(r-1)$. Since $b+r=n$, this leads to condition $r+r(r-1) = r^2 \\ge n$, i.e. $r \\ge \\lceil\\sqrt{n}\\rceil$, so $b \\le n - \\lceil\\sqrt{n}\\rceil$.\n\nA simple model is given by $r = \\lceil\\sqrt{n}\\rceil$ red points of coordinates $R_i(r_i, 0)$, with $0 < r_i < 2$, for all $i = 1, 2, \\dots, r$. Take $n-r$ blue points among those $r(r-1)$ given by all pairs $(i, j)$, $1 \\le i < j \\le r$, and of coordinates $B_{i,j}(x_{i,j}, b_{i,j})$ and $B'_{i,j}(x_{i,j}, -b_{i,j})$, with\n\n$$\nx_{i,j} = \\frac{r_i + r_j}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b_{i,j} = \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{r_i - r_j}{2}\\right)^2}.\n$$\n\nIt is trivial to check that all blue points $B_{i,j}$, $B'_{i,j}$ are distinct, while on unit circles of these centers lie points $R_i$ and $R_j$, and only them.\n\nThe choices made warrant that $n - r \\le r(r-1)$, since it comes to $n \\le \\lceil\\sqrt{n}\\rceil^2$, and that $(r_i - r_j)^2/4 < 1$. For the given $n = 2009$, the answer is thus that the largest possible number of blue points is $2009 - \\lceil\\sqrt{2009}\\rceil = 2009 - 45 = 1964$.\n\n**REMARKS.** The variant where the red points are allowed to also lie inside the circles is even easier – the answer is $b \\le n - 2$. A model is given by $n - 2$ blue points lying on a circle of center $O$ and radius $\\varrho < 1$, thus the disk of center $O$ and radius $1 - \\varrho$ is contained in each blue-centerd unit disk; take 2 red points inside it.\n\nBack to the original problem, a configuration of $r$ red points accommodates the maximum number $b$ of blue points if and only if the distance between any two is less than 2, while the circumradius of any three is different from 1 (this is not anymore true if we have some leeway as to the number of blue points – for example in our case, since $45^2 = 2025 > 2009$, we can take 3 of the red points as vertices of a triangle of side $\\sqrt{3}$, which only accommodates 4, instead of 6, blue points). Another easy model is thus given by the vertices of a regular $r$-gon of circumradius less than 1.",

We have $OX \\perp K_1K_3$ and $OY \\perp K_2K_4$. Let $Z = OX \\cap K_1K_3$, $T = OY \\cap K_2K_4$. Notice that triangles $\\triangle OK_3X$ and $\\triangle OZK_3$ are similar, and also similar are triangles $\\triangle OK_4Y$ and $\\triangle OTK_4$, hence $OY \\cdot OT = OK_4^2 = OK_3^2 = OX \\cdot OZ$.\n\nThis means that triangles $\\triangle OXT$ and $\\triangle OYZ$ are similar, hence $YZ \\perp OX$, and so $Y \\in K_1K_3$. $\\square$\n\nSuppose now lines $A_2A_3$, $A_4A_1$ and $T_1T_3$ are concurrent at a point $P$. Let $T'_4, T'_2$ be the tangency points of lines $A_4A_1$, respectively $A_2A_3$, to circle $\\omega_1$, and let $T'_3$ be the second meeting point of line $T_1T_3$ and circle $\\omega_1$. Let the tangent to $\\omega_1$ at $T'_3$ meet the lines $A_4A_1$, $A_2A_3$ at points $A'_4$, respectively $A'_3$. The (direct) homothety of center $P$ that takes $\\omega_1$ to $\\omega_3$ maps $T'_3$ to $T_3$, hence $A_3A_4 \\parallel A'_3A'_4$.\n\nLet $Q = A_1A_2 \\cap A_3A_4$, $Q' = A_1A_2 \\cap A'_3A'_4$. Applying the LEMMA to circle $\\omega_1$ and lines $A_2A_3$, $A'_3A'_4$, $A_4A_1$, $A_1A_2$, yields that points $Q'$, $T'_2$, $T'_4$ are collinear. The (inverse) homothety of center $A_1$ that takes $\\triangle QA_1A_4$ to $\\triangle Q'A_1A'_4$ maps $\\omega_4$ to $\\omega_1$, so maps $T_4$ to $T'_4$, hence $Q'T'_4 \\parallel QT_4$. Similarly, the (inverse) homothety of center $A_2$ that takes $\\triangle QA_2A_3$ to $\\triangle Q'A_2A'_3$ maps $\\omega_2$ to $\\omega_1$, so maps $T_2$ to $T'_2$, hence also $Q'T'_2 \\parallel QT_2$. Since points $Q'$, $T'_2$, $T'_4$ are collinear, it follows points $Q, T_2, T_4$ are also collinear.\n\nThe converse implication is done in a similar way, due to the cyclic nature of the notations used (just increase each index by 1).\n\n\\textit{Alternative Solution.} (D. \\c{S}erb\\u{a}nescu) Suppose $Q, T_2, T_4$ are collinear.

Let $T''_4$ be the (other than $T_2$) meeting point of line $QT_2T_4$ and circle $\\omega_2$, and let the tangent line to $\\omega_2$ at $T''_4$ (parallel to $A_1A_4$) meet $A_2A_3$ at $P'$ (via the (direct) homothety of center $Q$ that takes $\\omega_4$ to $\\omega_2$).\n\nClearly $\\triangle PT_2T_4 \\sim \\triangle P'T_2T_4''$ and $\\triangle P'T_2T_4''$ is isosceles, so $PT_2 = PT_4$ (in other words, if $Q, T_2, T_4$ are collinear then $PT_2 = PT_4$; the other implication trivially also holds, but is irrelevant here).\n\nFrom $PT_2 = PT_4$ and $PT'_2 = PT'_4$ follows $T'_2T_2 = T'_4T_4$.

The idea is to search for a polynomial $f$ such that $f(x, y) = 0$ is the equation of an ellipse centered at $B$, passing through $O$ and with tangent line $y = 0$ at $O$. In fact, if $f$ is chosen like this, the ellipse $f(x, y) = 0$ is completely contained in the region $\\{(x, y) ; 0 \\le y \\le \\frac{2}{3}\\}$, with $O$ the only integer point on the ellipse or in its interior; clearly, the absolute minimum of $f(x, y)$ is attained at $B$ and $f(x, y)$ is positive at all integer points other than $O$. Therefore, we consider polynomials of the type\n\n$$\nf(X, Y) = 9M(X - x_0)^2 + 9N(X - x_0)(Y - y_0) + 9P(Y - y_0)^2 - Q\n$$\n\nwhere $M, N, P, Q$ are integers with $M, P, Q, 4MP - N^2 > 0$.\n\nThe condition that the ellipse $f(x, y) = 0$ passes through $O$, with tangent line $y = 0$ at $O$, is expressed by\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases} 6029^2 M + 6029N + P - Q = 0 \\\\ 2 \\cdot 6029M + N = 0. \\end{cases}\n$$\n\nIt is then sufficient to choose $M = 1$, $N = -2 \\cdot 6029$, $P$ any integer greater than $6029^2$ and $Q = P - 6029^2$.\n\n\\textit{Alternative Solution.} (D. Schwarz)\n\nGiven any integer point $A(a_1, a_2)$, there exist infinitely many points $B(b_1, b_2)$ with $b_1, b_2 \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\setminus \\mathbb{Z}$, and such that $|a_1 - b_1| + |a_2 - b_2| = 2010$, for example $b_1 = a_1 + \\alpha + r$, $b_2 = a_2 + \\beta + (1 - r)$, with $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{Z}_+$, $r \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\cap (0, 1)$, and $\\alpha + \\beta = 2009$. We now will consider polynomials of the type\n\n$$\nf(X, Y) = N \\left( (X - a_1)^2 + (Y - a_2)^2 + \\varepsilon \\right) \\left( (X - b_1)^2 + (Y - b_2)^2 \\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\varepsilon \\in \\mathbb{Q}_+^*$ and $N \\in \\mathbb{Z}_+^*$ large enough for $f(X, Y)$ to have integer coefficients.\n\nOne then has $f(b_1, b_2) = 0$, while $f(x, y) > 0$ for all points $(x, y)$ in the plane, other than $B$.\n\nOne also then has $f(a_1, a_2) = N\\varepsilon((a_1 - b_1)^2 + (a_2 - b_2)^2)$, while one has, for all integer points $(n_1, n_2)$ in the plane, other than $A$,\n\n$$\n\\min \\{(n_1 - a_1)^2 + (n_2 - a_2)^2 + \\varepsilon\\} = 1 + \\varepsilon \\quad \\text{and} \\\\ \\min \\{(n_1 - b_1)^2 + (n_2 - b_2)^2\\} = m,\n$$\n\nfor some $m \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\cap (0, \\frac{1}{2}]$ (for example $m = \\frac{1}{2}$ when $r = \\frac{1}{2}$), therefore $F(n_1, n_2) > N(1+\\varepsilon)m$. In order to have $f(n_1, n_2) > f(a_1, a_2)$ it is thus enough that $N(1+\\varepsilon)m \\ge N\\varepsilon((a_1 - b_1)^2 + (a_2 - b_2)^2)$, therefore let us take\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon = m / ((a_1 - b_1)^2 + (a_2 - b_2)^2 - m) \\in \\mathbb{Q}_+^*,\n$$\n\nand then choose some appropriate $N$.\n\n\\textbf{REMARKS.} It is a case of applying the knowledge that some closed simple curve given by $f(x, y) = 0$ separates the plane into two regions, with values of one sign in the interior region, and values of the opposite sign in the exterior region. Once this idea comes to mind, the problem turns into a simple exercise in analytic geometry of the conics.\n\nNotice that the point $C(2x_0, 2y_0)$, the symmetrical of $A$ with respect to $B$, also lies on the ellipse $F(x, y) = 0$. What in fact we have done is to take the circle given by equation $\\Gamma(x, y) = (x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2 - (x_0^2 + y_0^2)$ and then stretch it on a direction perpendicular to $OB$, until a resulting rational ellipse contains no other integer points than $A$.",

The key to the proof is to sequence the elements of $K$ as $A_0, A_1, \\dots, A_{2n}$ such that the graph $G_k := G[A_0, A_1, \\dots, A_k]$ is connected for every $1 \\le k \\le 2n$; this can be done through\n\n\\textbf{LEMMA.}$^6$ The vertices of a finite connected graph $G$ can always be enumerated, say as a sequence $v_0, \\dots, v_{|G|-1}$, so that $G_k := G[v_0, \\dots, v_k]$ is connected for every $1 \\le k \\le |G|-1$.\n\n\\textit{Proof.} Pick any vertex as $v_0$, and assume inductively that $v_0, \\dots, v_k$ have been chosen for some $0 \\le k < |G| - 1$. Now pick a vertex $v \\in G - G_k$. As $G$ is connected, it contains a $v - v_0$ path $P$. Choose as $v_{k+1}$ the last vertex of $P$ in $G - G_k$; then $v_{k+1}$ has as neighbor in $G_k$ the next vertex of $P$. The connectedness of every $G_k$ follows by induction on $k$. $\\square$\n\nMoreover, if we just keep the edges through which $A_{k+1}$ has the (selected) neighbor in $G_k$, then $G_k$ is a tree, and so $G_{2n}$ is a spanning tree of $G$. Call the vertex\n\nhorizontal (vertical) if the edge that connects him is horizontal (vertical). Denote by $h$, respectively $v$, the number of horizontal, respectively vertical vertices; since $G_{2n}$ is a tree, it follows $h + v = 2n$. The point $A_0$ contributes $2n + 1$ vectors $\\overrightarrow{A_0A_i}$. Now, for $0 \\le k \\le 2n$, each point $A_{k+1}$ contributes at most $(2n+1) - x$ new vectors, where $x = h$ if the vertex is horizontal, respectively $x = v$ if the vertex is vertical, since those vectors $\\overrightarrow{A_{k+1}A_i}$, with ends at the corresponding edges of same direction, will be duplicated by the vectors determined by the opposite parallel sides of the parallelograms created, which have already been accounted for.\n\nTherefore the total number of distinct vectors will be $|W| \\le (2n+1)^2 - h^2 - v^2$. But $h^2 + v^2 \\ge \\frac{1}{2}(h+v)^2 = 2n^2$, hence $|W| \\le (2n+1)^2 - 2n^2 = 2n^2 + 4n + 1$.$^7$\n\n$^6$To be found in [DIESTEL, R., \\textit{Graph Theory}, Springer-Verlag, (2000)], Proposition 1.4.1.

The relations (1) and (2) show that there exists a number $k \\in \\mathbb{C}$ such that $x_2 = kx_1$, $x_4 = kx_3$ or $x_2 = kx_1$, $x_4 = \\bar{k}x_3$.\n\nIn the first case we have $a = kx_3^2 = (1+k)x_1$ and $b = kx_1^2 = (1+k)x_3$, so $a^3 = k(1+k)^2x_1^2x_3^2 = b^3$.\n\nIn the latter case we have $a = \\bar{k}x_3^2 = (1+k)x_1$ and $b = kx_1^2 = (1+\\bar{k})x_3$. It follows that $x_1^2\\bar{x}_1 = x_3\\bar{x}_3^2$, so $x_1 = \\bar{x}_3$ or $a = b = 0$, and furthermore $x_2 = \\bar{x}_4$, hence $a = \\bar{b}$.\n\nConversely, if $b = \\bar{a}$, then $x_1 + x_2 = \\bar{x}_3 + \\bar{x}_4$, $x_1x_2 = \\bar{x}_3\\bar{x}_4$, implying $\\{x_1, x_2\\} = \\{\\bar{x}_3, \\bar{x}_4\\}$. If $a^3 = b^3$, then $a = \\varepsilon b$, $\\varepsilon^3 = 1$. The roots satisfy the relations $x_1 + x_2 = \\varepsilon(x_3 + x_4)$, $x_1x_2 = \\varepsilon^2x_3x_4$. Both cases lead to $\\{|x_1|, |x_2|\\} = \\{|x_3|, |x_4|\\}$, as needed.",
