Since $\\sum_{k=1}^{n}(\\pi(k) - k) = 0$, so from the two members of $\\{\\pi(k) - k | k = 1, 2, ..., n\\}$, one should be positive and the other one negative. Let $a$ be the positive and $-b$ be the negative members. Also let $A = \\{k | \\pi(k) - k = a\\}$ and $B = \\{k | \\pi(k) - k = -b\\}$. First note that if $i \\in A$ then $i + a + b \\in A$. Because if $i \\in A$ and $i + a + b \\le n$, then $\\pi(i) = i + a$ and hence $\\pi(i + a + b) \\ne i + a$, and so $\\pi(i + a + b) - (i + a + b) = a$, it means that $i + a + b \\in A$. Similarly, we can say that if $j \\in B$ (and $j - (a + b) \\ge 1$) then $j - (a + b) \\in B$.\n\nAlso, note that for every $1 \\le i \\le b$, we have $i \\in A$. So considering the above paragraph, if for $1 \\le i \\le n$, the remainder of $i$ upon division by $a + b$, be less than or equal to $b$, then $i \\in A$. Similarly for $n - a < i \\le n$, we have $i \\in B$. Thus from every $a + b$ consecutive numbers, there are at least $a$ of them in $B$ and hence if the remainder of the division of $j$ by $a + b$, be more than $b$, then $j \\in B$. So easily we deduce that $d = a + b|n$. For each divisor $d$ of $n$, there are $d-1$ different pairs of $(a, b)$ whose sum is $d$.

We use induction on $k$, the number of squares inside $P$, which is more than one by assumption. For $k=2$ the assertion is trivial. Suppose $k>2$. Consider a new graph whose nodes are the centers of the squares inside $P$ and two nodes are adjacent if and only if their corresponding squares have a common edge (not necessarily in $P$). This graph is trivially connected and has no cycles, because if it has a cycle, then there is a vertex inside it which is also inside $P$. So the graph is a tree and has a leaf.

Similarly $B', C', D'$ and $E'$ are orthocenter of triangles $ABC, BCD, CDE$ and $DEA$ respectively. Note that $A'E$ and $B'C$ are both perpendicular to $AB$ so they are parallel.

Sort the vertices of $C - \\{x_0\\}$ as $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_{n-1}$ such that the angles $\\angle x_i x_0 y$ are increasing. So $C - \\{x_0, x_1\\}$ is entirely in one side of $x_0x_1$ and $C - \\{x_0, x_{n-1}\\}$ is entirely in one side of $x_0x_{n-1}$. There are at least $2 \\times 2^{n-3}$ good paths with vertices of $C - \\{x_0\\}$ starting at either $x_1$ or $x_{n-1}$. By joining the segments $x_0x_1$ or $x_0x_{n-1}$ we obtain at least $2^{n-2}$ good paths with the vertices of $C$ starting at $x_0$.\n\nIf $C$ is convex, then in any good path starting at $x_0$, $x_0$ should be joined to $x_1$ or $x_{n-1}$, because in other cases the vertices will be in both sides of the first segment and the path will intersect the first segment. So equality for convex sets follows by the induction hypothesis.\n\nNow, suppose $C$ is not convex. Let $z$ be a vertex of $C$ not on the convex hull. Either $z$ is in triangle $x_0x_1x_{n-1}$ or is inside the convex hull of $C - \\{x_0\\}$ (depending on which side of $x_1x_{n-1}$ that $z$ is in). In the first case, if $z'$ is the farthest vertex from line in triangle $x_0x_1x_{n-1}$ (other than $x_0$), then the segment $x_0z'$ doesn't intersect the convex hull of $C - \\{x_0\\}$ and there is a good path starting with $x_0z'$ by the induction hypothesis. In the second case, $C - \\{x_0\\}$ is not convex and the number of good paths starting with $x_0x_1$ is more than $2^{n-3}$ by the induction hypothesis. So the lemma is proved. \\(\\Box\\)\n\nAccording to the lemma, we have $T(B) = n2^{n-3}$. We prove $T(A) > n2^{n-3}$. Let $x_0$ be a vertex on the convex hull of $A$ and sort the other vertices of $A$ as described in the lemma. For any $1 \\le i \\le n-2$, by joining any two good paths starting at $x_0$ with vertices of $\\{x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_i\\}$ and $\\{x_0, x_{i+1}, \\dots, x_{n-1}\\}$, we get a good path with the vertices of $A$, because the two sets can be divided by a line through $x_0$. This way we get $\\sum_{i=1}^{n-2} 2^{i-1} \\times 2^{n-i-2} = (n-2)2^{n-3}$ good vertices not starting at $x_0$. There are more than $2^{n-2}$ good vertices starting at $x_0$ and so $T(A) > n2^{n-3}$. So, the assertion is proved. \\(\\Box\\)",

The orientations of the rotations are the same, because all the equations in the proof remain valid by considering orientations.

Hence we can choose a small value of $x$ having a different sign from it's coefficient for $\\Delta$ to be less than 0. Therefore, each three consecutive nonzero numbers among $k_i$'s must form an arithmetic progression. By modifying $n$ if necessary, we can assume that the sequence $k_1, k_2, \\dots$ and $k_n$ is a decreasing arithmetic progression of nonzero numbers, so $k_i = r - si$ for constants $r, s \\ge 0$.

Throughout the solution all polygons are considered to have vertices from lattice points.

So $u_j \\times u_l - u_j \\times u_{l'}$ is a multiple of $u_j \\times u_{n+1}$. Note that elements of $C_i$ lie on two lines parallel to $u_{n+1}$. Consequently\n\\[\n\\sum_{u_l \\in C_i} |u_j \\times u_l| \\ge 4J \\binom{\\frac{k_i}{4}}{2}\n\\]\nwhere we have assumed $u_j \\in C_J$.\n\nSumming these inequalities on index $i$ implies\n\\[\n\\sum_{l \\le n} |u_j \\times u_l| \\ge 4J \\sum_i \\binom{\\frac{k_i}{4}}{2}.\n\\]\nThen by summing on index $j$ we have\n\\[\n\\sum_{j,l} |u_j \\times u_l| \\ge 4 \\left( \\sum i k_i \\right) \\sum_i \\binom{\\frac{k_i}{4}}{2} = \\left( \\sum i k_i \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{8} \\sum k_i^2 - \\frac{n}{2} \\right).\n\\]\nSince $\\sum k_i = n$ and $\\sum ik_i \\le \\frac{1}{50}n^2$, by applying lemma 2 we obtain $\\sum k_i^2 \\ge \\frac{25}{2}n$.

Suppose that $C$ is the shortest path in $G$ that lies in just one highway and assume $C \\subset C_1$. Note that because of minimality, $C$ cannot cross itself, so is a simple curve, therefore dividing the plane into two regions. Now, $C-C_1$ is a closed or maybe an empty curve.\n\nSuppose that $H$ is the graph consisting of $C-C_1, C_2, \\dots$ and $C_n$. Since the number of edges of $H$ is less than $G$, $H$ has a good coloring according to the induction hypothesis. Now, we add curve $C$ to $H$ and change the color of faces inside $C$. It is very easy to check that this is a good coloring of $G$. The base case is when $G$ is empty. In this case we have only one region which obviously has a good coloring!\n\nFinally consider a good coloring (by colors black and white) for the graph $G$ and an arbitrary orientation for each highway. We have two types of edges. For some edges when we are moving through one (in its specified direction) our right face is white. We call such edges, edges of type 1 and others, edges of type 2. Build a bridge in the way of each edge of type 1.\n\nNote that in each crossroad exactly two of the edges are directed into the crossroad and only one of those two is of type 1. Hence our construction do not cause any contradictions.",

It means that we can suppose the coefficient of $\\vec{i}$ for one of them is zero. hence, if we want to go from one vertex to another, the difference of the coefficients of $\\vec{i}$ must be a multiple of $s$, since $t\\vec{j}$ does not affect the coefficient of $\\vec{i}$. As a result, for two equivalent vertices, we can first use vector $s\\vec{i} + r\\vec{j}$ several times to match their first coordinate. Then, we must use $t\\vec{j}$ to match the second coordinate. Hence we have $st$ nonequivalent vertices. But\n\n$$\nst = \\det \\begin{bmatrix} s & r \\\\ 0 & t \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nwhich is invariant during the process.\n\n$$\n\\det \\begin{bmatrix} s & r \\\\ 0 & t \\end{bmatrix} = \\det \\begin{bmatrix} m+n & m \\\\ n & m+n \\end{bmatrix} = m^2 + mn + n^2\n$$\n\nSo the maximum number of nonequivalent vertices is $m^2 + mn + n^2$.",

By applying lemma 1 for circle $C_2$, points $A$ and $D$ are also anti-homologous points for $\\omega_1$ and $l'$. Using the fact that the arcs are all in one side of $l$, it is easily seen that $A$ and $D$ are also direct anti-homologous points, so $ABCD$ is a cyclic quadrilateral.\n\nSimilarly, by considering anti-homologous points for pairs of circles $\\{\\omega_2, \\omega_1'\\}$, $\\{l', \\omega_2'\\}$ we conclude that quadrilaterals $BCDE$ and $CDEF$ are also cyclic, so points $A, B, C, D, E$ and $F$ lie on a circle which we call it $C_4$.\n\nThe rest of the proof is the same as the first solution. \\u25a1\n\n\\textbf{Third Solution.} Define points $A, B, \\dots, F$ and circles $C_1, C_2$ and $C_3$ similar to the first solution. We can suppose that $X$ is between $X'$ and $O$, without loss of generality. Thus, $C_1$ and $C_2$ are disjoint and $C_3$ contains both of them. According to lemma 1 and the fact that $\\omega_1$ lies entirely on one side of $l$, points $A$ and $B$ are direct anti-homologous points for $C_2$ and $C_1$. Similarly, $B$ and $C$ are inverse anti-homologous points for $C_1$ and $C_3$ and points $C$ and $D$ are direct anti-homologous points for $C_3$ and $C_2$. Pairs of points $\\{D, E\\}$ and $\\{E, F\\}$ are also anti-homologous in a similar manner as are pairs $\\{A, B\\}$ and $\\{B, C\\}$, respectively.\n\nOur motivation is that two anti-homologous points are related to each other by an inversion depending only on the two circles. So the problem says that the composition of six particular inversions is the identity. With this intuition in mind, we move all points to $C_1$. Let $A', C', D'$ and $F'$ be points on $C_1$ such that pairs $\\{A, A'\\}$ and $\\{D, D'\\}$ are"

Thus, for each $i$, the number $N(v_iv_1) - N(v_iv_2)$ is constant. We denote by $K$ this constant value. Now, let $n_i$ be the number we want to assign to the vertex $v_i$. We must have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} n_1 - n_2 &= N(v_1v_i) - N(v_2v_i) = K \\\\ n_1 + n_2 &= N(v_1v_2). \\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBy solving this system of equations we get the numbers due to the vertices $v_1$ and $v_2$. Now, for each $i$ let $n_i = N(v_iv_1) - n_1$. We claim that these numbers satisfy the assertion for complete graphs. For this, we must show that for every $i$ and $j$, $n_i + n_j = N(v_iv_j)$. For $j = 2$ this is equivalent to the second relation in the above system.\n\nFor other values of $j$, consider 4-cycle $v_1v_iv_jv_2v_1$. we have\n\n$$\nN(v_1v_2) + N(v_iv_j) = N(v_1v_i) + N(v_2v_j).\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\nn_1 + n_2 + N(v_iv_j) = n_1 + n_i + n_j + n_2 \\Rightarrow N(v_iv_j) = n_i + n_j.\n$$\n\nThis finishes the proof of the base case."

By these definitions the following lemma is obvious.\n\n\\textbf{Lemma.} Suppose that $e$ is a lattice edge of the lattice square $S$. Furthermore, assume that $e$ is not included in the boundary of any tile that lies in the same side of $e$ as $S$. By these conditions, there exist a lattice triangle and a small triangle containing $e$ which is contained in $S$ that are not covered by any tiles. $\\square$\n\nConsider a graph with lattice edges as its vertices. Two vertices are connected if and only if their corresponding edges are on the boundary of the same tile. In this graph the degree of each vertex is at most two. Furthermore, two connected vertices correspond to parallel edges, and if the degree of a vertex corresponding to a horizontal (vertical) edge is 2, one of the edges connected to this edge in the graph is above (right of) it and the other lies below (left of) it. Hence, each connected component of the graph is a path containing parallel lattice edges, and the order of vertices in this path coincides with the order of one of the coordinates of the corresponding edges (x-coordinate for vertical edges and y-coordinate for horizontal edges).\n\nThus, lattice edges on the line $y = n$ lie on different paths. We denote these paths by $U_1, U_2, \\dots, U_n$. Note that some of $U_i$'s might contain only one vertex. The bottommost lattice edges of these paths are different. Let $SU_i$ be the lattice square below the bottommost edge of $U_i$. If $SU_i$ lies above the line $y = 0$, according to the lemma one of the lattice triangles in $SU_i$ is not covered. We denote this triangle by $TU_i$. Furthermore, the upper small triangle in $SU_i$ is not covered. We denote this small triangle by $QU_i$. In the same manner, we denote by $D_1, D_2, \\dots$ and $D_n$ the paths containing lattice edges on the line $y = 0$, by $L_1, L_2, \\dots$ and $L_n$ the paths containing the edges on the line $x = 0$, and finally by $R_1, R_2, \\dots$ and $R_n$ the paths containing lattice edges on the line $x = n$. Triangles $TD_i, TL_i, TR_i, QD_i, QL_i$ and $QR_i$ are defined similarly. We have three cases:\n\nCase1. Suppose that there exists a path like $P$ containing one lattice edge of the lines $x = 0$ and $x = n$. In this case all the tiles of paths $U_1, U_2, \\dots$ and $U_n$ are above the tiles of the path $P$ and tiles of the paths $D_1, D_2, \\dots$ and $D_n$ lie below the tiles of the path $P$. Now, $2n$ paths $D_1, D_2, \\dots$ and $D_n$, and $U_1, U_2, \\dots$ and $U_n$ are all distinct, so the triangles $TU_1, TU_2, \\dots$ and $TU_n$, and $TD_1, TD_2, \\dots$ and $TD_n$ can be defined and are disjoint. Since these triangles are not covered, and the area of each of them is $\\frac{1}{2}$, the sum of the area of these triangles is $n$. Hence, the assertion is proved in this case.\n\nCase2. There exists a path $P$ containing one lattice edge of the lines $y = 0$ and $y = n$. This case is similar to case 1.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/2013_p53_data_df0a4786eb.png \"\")\n\nAn example for case 2.\n\nCase 3. There are not any paths of cases 1 or 2, so small triangles $QD_i$, $QU_i$, $QL_i$ and $QR_i$, for $1 \\le i \\le n$, are all defined and are disjoint. Since these $4n$ triangles are not covered by any tiles and the area of each is $\\frac{1}{4}$, the sum of the areas of them is $n$, so the proof is complete.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/2013_p53_data_d375720ed3.png \"\")\n\nAn example for case 3.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/2013_p53_data_fb20d02609.png \"\")",

      "statement_latex": "18. Suppose that the room in the problem is the square $[0, n] \\times [0, n]$ in the Cartesian plane. Furthermore, throughout the solution we use these definitions:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item A lattice point: A point in the plane with integer coordinates.\n\\item A lattice square: A square with lattice points as vertices and side lengths one.\n\\item A lattice edge: A side of a lattice square.\n\\item A lattice triangle: A right isosceles triangle of side length 1 and lattice points as vertices.\n\\item A small triangle: A right isosceles triangle of side length $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ and a lattice edge as its hypotenuse.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe boundary of each tile contains two lattice edges and two diameters of two lattice squares, so we have two types of tiles. By these definitions the following lemma is obvious.\n\n\\textbf{Lemma.} Suppose that $e$ is a lattice edge of the lattice square $S$. Furthermore, assume that $e$ is not included in the boundary of any tile that lies in the same side of $e$ as $S$. By these conditions, there exist a lattice triangle and a small triangle containing $e$ which is contained in $S$ that are not covered by any tiles. $\\square$\n\nConsider a graph with lattice edges as its vertices. Two vertices are connected if and only if their corresponding edges are on the boundary of the same tile. In this graph the degree of each vertex is at most two. Furthermore, two connected vertices correspond to parallel edges, and if the degree of a vertex corresponding to a horizontal (vertical) edge is 2, one of the edges connected to this edge in the graph is above (right of) it and the other lies below (left of) it. Hence, each connected component of the graph is a path containing parallel lattice edges, and the order of vertices in this path coincides with the order of one of the coordinates of the corresponding edges (x-coordinate for vertical edges and y-coordinate for horizontal edges).\n\nThus, lattice edges on the line $y = n$ lie on different paths. We denote these paths by $U_1, U_2, \\dots, U_n$. Note that some of $U_i$'s might contain only one vertex. The bottommost lattice edges of these paths are different. Let $SU_i$ be the lattice square below the bottommost edge of $U_i$. If $SU_i$ lies above the line $y = 0$, according to the lemma one of the lattice triangles in $SU_i$ is not covered. We denote this triangle by $TU_i$. Furthermore, the upper small triangle in $SU_i$ is not covered. We denote this small triangle by $QU_i$. In the same manner, we denote by $D_1, D_2, \\dots$ and $D_n$ the paths containing lattice edges on the line $y = 0$, by $L_1, L_2, \\dots$ and $L_n$ the paths containing the edges on the line $x = 0$, and finally by $R_1, R_2, \\dots$ and $R_n$ the paths containing lattice edges on the line $x = n$. Triangles $TD_i, TL_i, TR_i, QD_i, QL_i$ and $QR_i$ are defined similarly. We have three cases:\n\nCase1. Suppose that there exists a path like $P$ containing one lattice edge of the lines $x = 0$ and $x = n$. In this case all the tiles of paths $U_1, U_2, \\dots$ and $U_n$ are above the tiles of the path $P$ and tiles of the paths $D_1, D_2, \\dots$ and $D_n$ lie below the tiles of the path $P$. Now, $2n$ paths $D_1, D_2, \\dots$ and $D_n$, and $U_1, U_2, \\dots$ and $U_n$ are all distinct, so the triangles $TU_1, TU_2, \\dots$ and $TU_n$, and $TD_1, TD_2, \\dots$ and $TD_n$ can be defined and are disjoint. Since these triangles are not covered, and the area of each of them is $\\frac{1}{2}$, the sum of the area of these triangles is $n$. Hence, the assertion is proved in this case.\n\nCase2. There exists a path $P$ containing one lattice edge of the lines $y = 0$ and $y = n$. This case is similar to case 1.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/2013_p53_data_df0a4786eb.png \"\")\n\nAn example for case 2.\n\nCase 3. There are not any paths of cases 1 or 2, so small triangles $QD_i$, $QU_i$, $QL_i$ and $QR_i$, for $1 \\le i \\le n$, are all defined and are disjoint. Since these $4n$ triangles are not covered by any tiles and the area of each is $\\frac{1}{4}$, the sum of the areas of them is $n$, so the proof is complete.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/2013_p53_data_d375720ed3.png \"\")\n\nAn example for case 3.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/2013_p53_data_fb20d02609.png \"\")"

The case $a_{n+1} = \\max\\{a_n, a_{n+1}\\}$ is proved similarly. \\u25a1\n\n**Lemma 3.** *There exists some natural number *k* such that *a*<sub>*k*</sub> = *a*<sub>*k*+1</sub>.*\n\n*Proof.* Assume to the contrary that the equality never holds, hence by lemma 2\n\n$a_{n+2} < \\max\\{a_n, a_{n+1}\\},$\n\nand\n\n$a_{n+3} < \\max\\{a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}\\} < \\max\\{a_n, a_{n+1}\\}.$\n\nTherefore,\n\n$\\max\\{a_{n+2}, a_{n+3}\\} < \\max\\{a_n, a_{n+1}\\}.$\n\nThus $\\max\\{a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}\\}$ is a strictly decreasing sequence of natural numbers. But there is no such sequence; therefore, our initial assumption is not true and the lemma is proved. $\\square$\n\nBy lemma 3, there exists some natural number $k \\ge 1$ such that $a_k = a_{k+1}$. This implies that $a_{k+2} = 4$. Now, if $a_k = a_{k+1} \\in \\{3, 4\\}$, then $a_{k+3} \\in \\{3, 4\\}$ and there is nothing left to prove, but if $a_k = a_{k+1} > 4$, there exists some natural number $m$ such that $a_{k+m} = a_{k+m+1}$. Using the proof of lemma 3, we have:\n\n* If *m* is odd,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\na_{k+1} &= \\max\\{a_{k+1}, a_{k+2} = 4\\} > \\max\\{a_{k+3}, a_{k+4}\\} > \\dots \\\\\n&> \\max\\{a_{k+m}, a_{k+m+1}\\} = a_{k+m}.\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n* If *m* is even,\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\na_{k+1} &= \\max\\{a_{k+1}, a_{k+2} = 4\\} > \\max\\{a_{k+3}, a_{k+4}\\} > \\dots \\\\\n&> \\max\\{a_{k+m-1}, a_{k+m}\\} \\ge a_{k+m}.\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nTherefore, if two equal consecutive terms in the sequence are greater than 4, there is another pair of equal consecutive terms in the sequence with a smaller value. We can continue this until we find two equal consecutive terms less than or equal 4. This completes the proof because the terms after that pair are 4, 3 or 4, 4.",

Note that this new graph has $2n$ edges, therefore an upper bound for $S_n$ is the number of lattice cycles with $2n$ edges. Hence we will estimate the number of such cycles.\n\nThe number of cycles of length $2n$ is at most as large as the number of strings consisting of letters $\\leftarrow, \\rightarrow, \\uparrow, \\downarrow$ such that\n\n$$\n\\text{Number of } \\rightarrow\\text{'s} = \\text{Number of } \\leftarrow\\text{'s}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\text{Number of } \\uparrow\\text{'s} = \\text{Number of } \\downarrow\\text{'s}.\n$$\n\nBy a combinatorial arguments it is easy to see that the number of such strings is\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\binom{2n}{k} \\binom{2n-k}{k} \\binom{2n-k}{n-k} = \\binom{2n}{n}^2 < 16^n.\n$$\n\nTherefore, $S_n \\leq 16^n$.\n\nc) The following figure shows a stupid 7-stick.\n\n![](images/2014_p32_data_8d7420d029.png)\n\nFor $n > 7$, if we start from $A$ or $B$ in the former 7-stick and add $n - 7$ horizontal or vertical edges, the final polystick is obviously stupid, because the segment $xy$ in the polystick which covers it does not have any adjacent edges.\n\n![](images/2014_p32_data_efcb8b0482.png)\n\nd) Consider an infinite path (say $L$) in the plane that alternatively goes up or right.\n\n\\textbf{Lemma 2.} Let $L_n$ be the translation of $L$ by vector $(-n, n)$.

So $e$ and its reflection with respect to the line $y = x$ are both edges of $L$ which is a contradiction, because $L$ goes alternatively up or right. $\\square$\n\nTherefore, $L$ and $L'$ and all their translations by vectors of the form $(-n, n)$ do not have an edge in common. Note that these paths cover all the lattice edges, because for every edge $e$ we can find an integer $n$ such that translation of $e$ by vector $(-n, n)$ intersects $L$. Now, if they intersect in an edge, $e$ lies in some translation of $L$ and if they intersect in a vertex, $e$ lies in some translation of $L'$. Finally, note that $L$ can be built by the head to tail attachment of an infinite number of polysticks that go alternatively up or right.\n\ne) If we use 4-sticks instead of 2-sticks in the second solution of part $b$, we get\n\n$$\nS_n \\geq (\\sqrt[4]{88})^n \\approx (3.06)^n.\n$$\n\nTo prove the upper bound, we introduce at most $16 \\times 8^n$ connected polysticks.

On the other hand, the $(n+1)$-mino corresponding to each $n$-stick is uniquely determined (if such an $(n+1)$-mino exists). So\n\n$$\nS_n \\geq \\text{The number of } n\\text{-sticks without any cycles} \\geq M_{n+1}.\n$$\n\nb) Consider the lattice paths of length $n$ which alternatively go up, right or left. There is an obvious bijection between these paths and strings of length $n$ with letters from the set $\\{\\rightarrow, \\leftarrow, \\uparrow\\}$, provided that there are no two adjacent $\\rightarrow$ and $\\leftarrow$ letters. Let $A_n$ be the number of such strings. We know that $8S_n \\geq A_n$, because we can put each $n$-stick in the plane in at most 8 different ways.

Therefore, $C_1(x, y)$, $C_1(y, z)$ and $C_1(z, x)$ form a partition of the perimeter of $A_o$.

We claim that $[x, z]$ and $[y, z]$ are both inner chords of $A_o$, because if not, there exists another point of the polygon inside triangle $xyz$ which contradicts the minimality of $z$. So $[x, z]$ and $[y, z]$ are both inner chords of $A_o$. But $z$ lies in $S$, therefore the lengths of $[x, z]$ and $[y, z]$ are less than 1.

Therefore, there is some vertex $z \\in C_2(x, y)$ such that $xyz$ forms one of the triangles of the triangulation. Note that if $y \\in C_1(x, z)$, then $d(x, z) > d(x, y)$ and this contradicts the maximality of $[x, y]$. Thus $y \\in C_2(x, z)$ and similarly $z \\in C_2(x, y)$. Therefore, $C_1(x, y)$, $C_2(x, y)$ and $C_3(x, y)$ form a partition of the perimeter of $A$.

For each directed closed broken line $\\sigma$ in the plane, let $\\kappa_{\\sigma}$ be the product of conversion factors along $\\sigma$.\n\n\\textbf{Lemma 1.} Let $\\sigma$ and $\\delta$ be two non-self-intersecting directed closed broken lines with opposite directions and $\\phi = (\\sigma \\cup \\delta) - (\\sigma \\cap \\delta)$. Obviously, $\\phi$ is a directed closed broken line with the same direction as $\\sigma$ and $\\delta$. We have $\\kappa_{\\phi} = \\kappa_{\\sigma}\\kappa_{\\delta}$.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/2014_p41_data_77368ffd6d.png)\n\n\\textit{Proof.} Note that each part of $\\phi$ is a part of exactly one of $\\sigma$ and $\\delta$. Furthermore, each part of $\\sigma \\cup \\delta - \\phi$ is a part of both $\\sigma$ and $\\delta$ and has opposite directions in these two directed closed broken lines. Hence the factors corresponding to the common parts of $\\sigma$ and $\\delta$ cancel each other and therefore $\\kappa_{\\phi} = \\kappa_{\\sigma}\\kappa_{\\delta}$. $\\square$\n\nUsing a stereographic projection from a vertex of the polyhedral, we can map the polyhedral on a plane. Note that the faces adjacent to the center of projection map to unbounded regions in the plane. Other faces and travel paths are sent to polygons in the plane.\n\nFor each vertex $v$ of this graph in the plane we define $c_v$ to be the product of conversion factors of its adjacent edges while traveling clockwise. We claim that for each closed broken line $\\sigma$, $\\kappa_\\sigma$ is a function of the factors that have been assigned to the vertices enclosed by $\\sigma$.\n\n\\textbf{Lemma 2.} For each directed closed broken line $\\sigma$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\kappa_{\\sigma} = \\prod_{v \\text{ inside } \\sigma} c_v \\quad \\text{If } \\sigma \\text{ is clockwise,}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\kappa_{\\sigma} = \\prod_{v \\text{ inside } \\sigma} c_v^{-1} \\quad \\text{If } \\sigma \\text{ is counterclockwise.}\n$$\n\n\\textit{Proof.} Obviously, it is sufficient to prove the lemma for the first case. If there are no vertices inside $\\sigma$, the proof is easy. For each edge of the graph, $\\sigma$ intersects that edge a same number of times from both directions and hence $\\kappa_{\\sigma} = 1$. Now, if some clockwise path $\\sigma$, that is not self-intersecting, encloses some vertices (say $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_k$), consider small counterclockwise paths $\\sigma_i$ with $\\kappa_{\\sigma_i} = c_{v_i}^{-1}$ such that $\\sigma_i$ encloses only $v_i$. We can write $\\sigma$ as a union of $\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\dots, \\sigma_k$ and some paths that do not enclose any vertices and thus by lemma 1,\n\n$$\n\\kappa_{\\sigma} = \\kappa_{\\sigma_1}^{-1} \\kappa_{\\sigma_2}^{-1} \\dots \\kappa_{\\sigma_k}^{-1} = c_{v_1} c_{v_2} \\dots c_{v_k}.\n$$\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/2014_p42_data_c24938d314.png)\n\nNow, according to the former lemma, for each closed boken line $\\sigma$ that is not self-intersecting, $\\kappa_{\\sigma} = \\prod_{v \\in A} c_v$ or $\\kappa_{\\sigma} = \\prod_{v \\in A} c_v^{-1}$, where $A$ is a subset of the vertices (except the one that maps to infinity). The number of such subsets is $2^{v-1}$ where $v$ is the number of the vertices of the polyhedral. Note that an empty set gives the $\\kappa = 1$ in both of the equations and hence the number of mutually different amounts of money is at most $2 \\times (2^{v-1}) - 1 = 2^v - 1$.\n\nNow, we claim that for each nonempty subset $A$ of the vertices in the plane and each arbitrary direction there is a non-self-intersecting path in the form of a closed broken line with vertices of $A$ as its inner points. To prove it, draw small curves around points of $A$ with the given direction. We can combine these curves using arcs joining the points of $A$ to get the desired path.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/2014_p42_data_9ddfd00b15.png)\n\nWe claim that by assigning different prime numbers to different edges of the polyhedral as conversion factors, two paths with different $\\kappa$ have different inner points or different directions. Assume that for two paths $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$, $\\kappa_{\\sigma_1} = \\kappa_{\\sigma_2}$. If they have the same direction, we may combine them to get a path with $\\kappa = \\kappa_{\\sigma_1}^2$, and if they have different directions, we first change the direction of $\\sigma_2$ to get another path $\\sigma'_2$ and then combine $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma'_2$ to get a path with $\\kappa = 1$. Let this new path be $\\gamma$. Note that in each case, the power of each prime number $p$ in $\\kappa_{\\gamma}$ is even $(0, 2 \\text{ or } -2)$. It means that every edge of the graph has an even number of adjacent vertices among vertices inside $\\gamma$. But this is a contradiction since there is always an edge that is adjacent to only one vertex among a given set of vertices (note that there are also some unbound edges). For this reason, the maximum number of $\\kappa$'s is $2^v - 1$. Now, our goal is to find an upper bound for $v$ in terms of $n$. Since the projected graph is planar, we have\n\n$$\nv = 2 - n + e \\leq 2 - n + 3n - 6 = 2n - 4,\n$$\n\nand equality holds when all the vertices of the polyhedral have degree 3. Obviously, a $(n-2)$-gonal prism is an example of such polyhedral. Hence we have proved that the desired number is $2^{2n-4} - 1$.",

On the other hand by corollary 3, there exists exactly one entry equal to 2 in the union of rows 2 and 3, so row 1 contains at most one entry equal to 2. Since $r_1 = 6$ and all of the entries of row 1 are positive, row 1 does not have any 2's. Therefore, $a_{1,0} = a_{1,2} = a_{1,3} = 1$ and $a_{1,1} = 3$.

Therefore, $\\{a_{1,2}, a_{2,2}\\} = \\{0, 1\\}$. Then $a_{1,2} = 2$ and $a_{1,0} = a_{1,3} = 1$. Consequently, $a_{2,3} = 1$, $a_{2,2} = 0$, $a_{0,2} = 3$ and $a_{0,3} = 2$.

So each row contains at least one entry equal to 2 and so each number $0 \\le j \\le n-1$ has appeared in the table at least 2 times.

Since row zero contains exactly one entry equal to 0 and all of the entries of row 1 are positive, the number of 0's in rows 2, 3, ..., $n-1$ is equal to $r_0 - 1$ and thus $n(n-2) - (r_0 - 1)$ entries of these rows are positive.

In this case row 1 contains three entries equal to 1, one entry equal to 2 and one entry equal to 3. So $a_{2,1} = a_{3,1} = 1$ and $a_{4,1} = 0$. Since $a_{1,4} > 0$, by corollary 3 we get $a_{4,0} = 1$ and consequently $a_{0,4} = 4$ and $a_{2,4} = a_{3,4} = 0$. On the other hand, $a_{0,3} \\ge 3$, but row 0 contains one entry 4 ($a_{0,4}$), so $a_{0,3} = 3$. Again by corollary 3, we get $a_{2,2}+a_{2,3}+a_{2,4} = 1$. Therefore, $\\{a_{1,2}, a_{2,2}\\} = \\{0, 1\\}$. Then $a_{1,2} = 2$ and $a_{1,0} = a_{1,3} = 1$. Consequently, $a_{2,3} = 1$, $a_{2,2} = 0$, $a_{0,2} = 3$ and $a_{0,3} = 2$.

Therefore, $a_{0,3} = 4$, $a_{2,3} = 0$ and $a_{3,0} = 1$ (since $a_{1,3} = 1$). We know that $a_{4,0} \\ge 1$ and $a_{4,1} = a_{1,4} = 1$. So $a_{4,0} = 2$ and hence $a_{2,4} = 1$ and $a_{2,0} = 0$.

Since $S=16$ is even, the number of 3's in the table must be even and so $r_3 = 2$ ($r_3 = 0$ implies $a_{0,3} = 4$ which is a contradiction!). So $r_2 = 2$ and $r_0 = 6$. On the other hand by corollary 3, there exists exactly one entry equal to 2 in the union of rows 2 and 3, so row 1 contains at most one entry equal to 2. Since $r_1 = 6$ and all of the entries of row 1 are positive, row 1 does not have any 2's. Therefore, $a_{1,0} = a_{1,2} = a_{1,3} = 1$ and $a_{1,1} = 3$. On the other hand, $\\{a_{2,3}, a_{2,2}\\} = \\{1, 0\\}$. According to the values of $c_2 = c_3 = 4$, one of $a_{0,3}$ and $a_{0,2}$ is 2 and the other one is 3. Therefore, $a_{2,0} = a_{3,0} = 1$. Now, we do not have any 2's in rows 2 and 3, so $S=15$ which is a contradiction.\n\n**Case 2.** $r_1 = 7$.

Thus, $a^b \\notin S$.\n\n* $1 < b^a < b^1 = b$, but $b$ was the least element of $S$ greater than one. Therefore, $b^a \\notin S$.\n\nSo our assumption leads to a contradiction proving the lemma. □\n\nAccording to this lemma, if $S$ is a finite powerful set, all of its elements are in $[1, \\infty)$ or in $(0, 1]$.\n\nFirstly, suppose that $S$ is a powerful set with $n > 3$ number of elements in $[1, \\infty)$ ($S = \\{1 = a_1 < a_2 < \\cdots < a_n\\}$). Note that we can assume that $a_1 = 1$, because if $1 \\notin S$, we can add it to $S$ to get a powerful set with more elements. For $i \\ge 2$, $a_n^{a_i} > a_n$ and so $a_i^{a_n}$ must be in $S$. We have\n\n$$\na_1 < a_2 < a_2^{a_n} < a_3^{a_n} < \\cdots < a_{n-1}^{a_n}\n$$\n\nSo for $2 \\le i \\le n - 1$, $a_i^{a_n} = a_{i+1}$. Now for $a_2 < a_{n-1}$ ($n > 3$) we have\n\n$$\na_2 < a_2^{a_{n-1}} < a_2^{a_n} = a_3 \\Rightarrow a_2^{a_{n-1}} \\notin S\n$$\n\n$$\na_{n-1} < a_{n-1}^{a_2} < a_{n-1}^{a_n} = a_n \\Rightarrow a_{n-1}^{a_2} \\notin S\n$$\n\nbut this contradicts, because $S$ was a powerful set.\n\nNow suppose that $S$ is a powerful set with $n > 4$ elements in $(0, 1]$. Let $S = \\{a_1 < a_2 < \\cdots < a_n = 1\\}$. Again we may assume $1 \\in S$. Similar to the previous part, for each $1 \\le i \\le n - 2$, $a_{n-1} < a_{n-1}^{a_i} < 1$. So $a_n^{a_i} \\notin S$, and consequently $a_i^{a_n} \\in S$. We have\n\n$$\na_1 < a_1^{a_{n-1}} < a_2^{a_{n-1}} < \\cdots < a_{n-2}^{a_n} < 1\n$$\n\nSo we get $a_i^{a_{n-1}} = a_{i+1}$ for each $2 \\le i \\le n - 2$. Now if we denote $a_{n-1}$ by $a$, we get\n\n$$\na_{n-2} = a^{\\frac{1}{a}}, a_{n-3} = a^{\\frac{1}{a^2}}, \\dots\n$$\n\nNow by looking at $a_{n-1}$ and $a_{n-2}$, we conclude\n\n$$\na_{n-1} = a_{n-2}^{a_{n-1}} < a_{n-1}^{a_{n-2}} < 1 \\Rightarrow a_{n-1}^{a_{n-2}} \\notin S\n$$\n\nThis implies $a_{n-2}^{a_{n-1}} \\in S$. Since $a_{n-2}^{a_{n-1}} > a_{n-2}^{a_n} = a_{n-1}$, we get $a_{n-2}^{a_{n-1}} = a_n$. So\n\n$$\na_{n-2}^{a_{n-1}} = (a^{1/a^2})^{(a^{1/a})} = a \\implies a^{(a^{1/a})-2} = a \\Rightarrow a^{\\frac{1}{a}-2} = 1\n$$\n\nBut $a \\ne 1$ and so $a = \\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, $a_{n-1} = \\frac{1}{2}$, $a_{n-2} = \\frac{1}{4}$ and $a_{n-3} = \\frac{1}{16}$. Now since $n > 4$, $a_{n-4} = \\frac{1}{256} \\in S$ but it is easy to see none of $a_{n-3}^{a_{n-4}}$ and $a_{n-4}^{a_{n-3}}$ is not in $S$. So there is no powerful set with more than 4 elements.",

Let $D = (a, b)$ and $x = (x_1, x_2) = f^{-1}(b)$. Since $b$ is greater than all the elements of $D$, $x$ must be greater than any element of $C$ and so $x_1 > 0$. But $(\\frac{x_1}{2}, 0) \\in B$ is greater than any element of $C$ and less than $x$. Therefore, $f^{-1}(y) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is greater than any element of $D$, but is less than $b$, which is impossible. This contradiction shows that there is not such function $f$.\n\nd) No, there is not such function. In an ordered set $X$, we call that $y$ is the *successor* of $x$ whenever $x < y$ and there is no element between $x$ and $y$.

Now we want to show that there is not any increasing bijection from $A$ to $B$. Assume, to the contrary, that $h$ is such function.

Suppose that in some step, $l$ is the least natural number such that $a_l$ is not in the range of function $f$ (which is defined before this step). Let $\\{b_{i_1} < b_{i_2} < \\dots < b_{i_k}\\}$ be the range of $f$ and $b_l \\in (b_{i_r}, b_{i_{r+1}})$. Since $b_{i_r}$ and $b_{i_{r+1}}$ are in the range of $f$, there exist $a_s, a_t \\in A$ such that $f(a_s) = b_{i_r}$ and $f(a_t) = b_{i_{r+1}}$. Same as (i), we can choose $a \\in A \\cap (a_s, a_t)$ such that $a$ is not in the domain of $f$. Now we can define $f(a) = b_l$.\n\nIn each step, by using this two operations we add two numbers to the number of elements of domain and range of $f$. Furthermore, the least $k$ and $l$ which $a_k$ was not in the domain of $f$ and $b_l$ was not in the range of $f$ will be added to the domain and range, respectively. So if we repeat these two operations to infinity we get\n\n$$\n\\text{Domain of } f = A \\text{ and Range of } f = B\n$$\n\nand so $f$ is surjective. Moreover, since $f$ is strictly increasing in each step, we get an increasing bijection as desired.\n\nc) No, there is not such function. Suppose by contradiction that $f$ is such function. Consider the subset $C = \\{0\\} \\times \\mathbb{R} \\subseteq B$ and define $D = f^{-1}(C) \\in \\mathbb{R}$. If $x, y \\in C$ and $x < z < y$, then $z \\in C$. Since $f$ is assumed to be an increasing bijection, $D$"

The base case $n = 2$ is trivial. Now suppose that the assertion is true for $2(n-1)$-gons. Let $e_1, e_2, \\dots, e_{2n}$ be the sides of $P$. We call a rhombination *Standard*, whenever the path connecting $e_1$ to $e_{n+1}$ is adjacent to the sides $e_2, \\dots, e_n$. You can see an standard rhombination in the following shape.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/2015_p34_data_d67de98e47.png)\n\nWe claim that by applying the step mentioned in the problem statement, we can change each arbitrary rhombination to an standard one. For this end, suppose that we have an arbitrary rhombination of $P$ and let $C$ be the path connecting $e_1$ to $e_{n+1}$ in this. Assume that $C$ is adjacnet to $e_1, \\dots, e_{i-1}$ and $e_{j+1}$ but not to $e_i, e_{i+1}, \\dots, e_j$ ($2 \\le i \\le j \\le n$). Note that if $C$ is adjacent to all $e_1, \\dots, e_n$ there is nothing to prove. Otherwise, there is a rhombinated $2(j-i+1)$-gon $Q$ bounded by $C$ and sides $e_i, \\dots, e_j$ ($Q$ may not be convex). Denote the other sides of $Q$ by $e'_i, \\dots, e'_j$ ($e_i$ and $e'_i$ have common vertex). It suffices to show that one of vertices of $Q$ between $e'_i, \\dots, e'_j$ is adjacent to only one rhombus in $Q$. Therefore, this vertex is adjacent to exactly 3 rhombi in $P$ and if we apply the step on this vertex, the number of rhombi in the right of $C$ became smaller. So we will get an standard rhombination by several use of this trick.\n\nSince the path containing each $e_k$ intersects $C$ ($i \\le k \\le j$), we deduce that each of $e'_i, \\dots, e'_j$ has length and direction same as one of $e_i, \\dots, e_j$. Let $M_k$ be the rhombus containing $e'_k$ in $Q$. Suppose that $e'_k$ is parallel to $e_{g_k}$ and the other side of $M_k$ is parallel to $e_{f_k}$. Note that $f_k \\ne g_k$ (for each $k$). Our goal is to find some $k$ such that $f_k = g_{k+1}$. Suppose that there is not such $k$. We must have $f_i < g_i$, because if not $M_i$ will intersect $e_i$ or lies out of $Q$. Now suppose that $f_k < g_k$ (induction on $k \\ge i$). Since $e'_{k+1}$ is out of $M_k$, we infer $g_{k+1} \\ge f_k$ and because of our assumption $g_{k+1} > f_k$. On the other hand, $f_{k+1} < g_{k+1}$ because if not $M_{k+1}$ is out of $Q$ or may intersects $M_k$ (here we use $f_k \\ne g_{k+1}$, because we may have $M_k = M_{k+1}$ and then the conclusion became false). Now the induction is finished and so we have $f_k < g_k$ and $f_k < g_{k+1}$.\n\nConsider the side $e_{g_{k+1}}$ is parallel to $e_i$. Thus, $g_{k+1} = i$. But we have $f_k \\ge i$ and this leads to a contradiction by $g_{k+1} > f_k$.\n\nFinally, we can change each two different rhombinations to an standard one. Then by removing the path connecting $e_1$ to $e_{n+1}$, we get two rhombinations in a convex $(2n - 2)$-gon $P'$. Now by induction we deduce that we can transfer two these two rhombinations to a similar one. Therefore, we can transfer each rhombination to another by applying the step several number of times.\n\nd) According to the part (a), the path connecting $e_1$ to $e_{n+1}$ has $n-1$ rhombi, each one is the intersection of this path and another path connecting two other parallel sides. We have $n-1$ ways for choosing the second direction of the bottom rhombus. $n-2$ ways for choosing the second direction of the next rhombus,...\n\nAfter removing this path and translating two remaining parts, we get a rhombination in a 2(n − 1)-gon. So if we denote the number of rhombinations of an 2n-gon by f(n), we have\n\n\\[\nf(n) \\le (n-1)!f(n-1) \\Rightarrow f(n) \\le (n-1)! \\times (n-2)! \\times \\cdots \\times 2! \\times 1! = \\prod_{k=1}^{n-1} k^{n-k}\n\\]\n\nNow for the lower bound we define a semipath. By a *semipath* we mean a collection of sides of rhombi connecting to parallel sides of the polygon such that for each direction it has exactly one edge of that direction. Cutting a rhombinated 2(*n* − 1)-gon from one of its semipaths, then translating one of parts by a vector with length equal to the side of polygon and direction different from sides of 2(*n* − 1)-gon, and finally, filling the the space between two parts using some rhombi, we get a rhombination for a 2*n*-gon. So\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\text{Semipaths in a } 2(n-1)\\text{-gon} \\right) \\times f(n-1) \\le f(n) \\quad (*)\n\\]\n\nAnd by induction it is easy to show\n\n\\[\nk + \\left( \\text{Semipaths in a } 2(k-1)\\text{-gon} \\right) \\le \\left( \\text{Semipaths in a } 2k\\text{-gon} \\right)\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of semipaths in a 2k-gon is at least $1 + \\binom{k}{2}$. This and * imply the desired lower bound.",

This generalization is important for our induction in part (c).\n\na) Consider an arbitrary rhombination of $P$ and an arbitrary rhombus of this rhombination. Suppose that two parallel sides of this rhomus are parallel to the $x$ axis. In this case, we can extend this rhombus from up and down, using rhombi having two sides parallel to this. Continuing in this fashion, we will get two sides of $P$ from up and down.

Using Lagrange Interpolation, we can find a polynomial $p(x) \\in \\mathbb{R}[x]$ such that\n\n$$\np(z) = z, \\quad p(y_1) = y_2, \\quad p(y_2) = y_3, \\quad \\dots, \\quad p(y_m) = y_1\n$$\n\nIf it is necessary by changing $x^k(x-z)(x-y_1)\\cdots(x-y_m) + p(x)$ with $p(x)$ ($k \\in \\mathbb{N}$), we can assume that $p$ is a monic polynomial of odd degree. Now we define function $f$ as follows. If there is some integer $k \\ge 0$ and $1 \\le i \\le m$ such that $p^k(x) = y_i$, set $f(x) = y_{i-k}$ (Indices are assumed to be modulo $m$). Note that if $p^{k_1}(x) = y_i$ and $p^{k_2}(x) = y_j$, $y_{i-k_1} = y_{j-k_2}$. Thus, there is no ambiguity in the definition. Otherwise, define $f(x) = z$. We claim that this definition satisfies problem statement.\n\n* If $f(x) = y_i$, there is some integer $k$ such that $p^k(x) = y_{i+k}$. Now $p^k(p(x)) = p(y_{i+k}) = y_{i+k+1}$ and so $f(p(x)) = y_{i+k+1-k} = y_{i+1} = p(y_i) = p(f(x))$.\n* If $f(x) = z$, then obviously $f(p(x)) = z$ and so $f(p(x)) = z = p(z) = p(f(x))$.\n\nTherefore, the proof is complete.",

The answer is $k = 2n$. Firstly, note that for $k < 2n$ if we set $a_1 = a_2 = \\dots = a_k = 1$, we cannot choose an even number of $a_i$'s with sum divisible by $n$. On the other hand, if $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{2n}$ are $2n$ integers, then we define $S_i = a_1 + \\dots + a_{2i}$ for $i = 1, 2, \\dots, n$. By arguments same as the proof of the lemma, there is some $i$ such that $n|S_i$ or there exists $i < j$ such that $n|S_j - S_i$. In both cases we have found an even number of $a_i$'s having sum divisible by $n$.\n\n* $n = 2m$ is an even number. We claim that $k = n + 1 = 2m + 1$ is the answer. Note that for $k \\le 2m$, if we set $a_1 = a_2 = \\dots = a_{k-1} = 1$ and $a_k = 0$, it is not possible to select an even number of $a_i$'s having a sum divisible by $2m$. On the other hand, suppose that $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{2m+1}$ are $2m+1$ arbitrary integers. Assume that $b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_s$ are the even numbers among $a_i$'s and $c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_r$ are the odd numbers. Since $r+s = 2m+1$, exactly one of $r$ of $s$ is odd and the other is even. We suppose that $r$ is odd and $s$ is even (the other case is similar). Now look at the $m$ numbers $a_1+a_2, a_3+a_4, \\dots, a_{r-2}+a_{r-1}, b_1+b_2, \\dots, b_{s-1}+b_s$. Note that all these sums are even, so referring to the lemma, we can select some of them with sum divisible by $2m = n$. Since each of these numbers is sum of two member of $a_i$'s we have find an even number of $a_i$'s having a sum divisible by $n$, as desired.",

(We mean by a slice of $K$, intersection of a line in the plane with $K$. Obvoiusly each slice is a line segment.)\n\n\\textit{Proof.} Assume to the contrary there are three slices of length $r$ parallel to the given direction, say $AA'$, $BB'$ and $CC'$. Suppose that $\\overrightarrow{AA'} = \\overrightarrow{BB'} = \\overrightarrow{CC'}$ and $BB'$ lies between two others.\n\nIf $B$ or $B'$ is outside the parallelogram $AA'C'C$, then the other point lies in the interior of $K$ and therefore the intersection of line containing $BB'$ has length greater than $r$.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/2015_p47_data_f98afe1dd8.png)\n\nIf $B$ lies on $AC$ and $B'$ lies on $A'C'$, then since $K$ is strictly convex there must be a\npoint of $K$ between lines $AA'$ and $CC'$ outside the parallelogram, contradicts with the\nlength $r$ of slice containing $BB'$.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/2015_p47_data_5f0a600294.png)\n\n\\textbf{Lemma 3.} There are no four horizontal or four vertical rectangles satisfying the conditions.\n\n\\textit{Proof.} Assume that there are at least 4 horizontal rectangles. By a horizontal scaling with factor $\\frac{1}{2}$ we go to the case that there are 4 unit squares with sides parallel to the axes, such that mutually intersecting at rectangles of area $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nEvery unit square determined uniquely by its center. It is easy to see that two unit squares with centers $(x, y)$ and $(x', y')$ intersect at a rectangle of area $\\frac{1}{2}$ iff\n\n\\[\n(1 - |x - x'|)(1 - |y - y'|) = \\frac{1}{2} \\quad (*)\n\\]\n\nLocus of points $(x', y')$ satisfying (*) (for fixed $(x, y)$) is boundary of a strictly convex shape in the plane (Look at the shape below). We call such shape an oval with center $(x, y)$.\n\n% IMAGE: ![](images/2015_p48_data_854415573e.png)\n\nSuppose that $A = (x_A, y_A)$, $B = (x_B, y_B)$, $C = (x_C, y_C)$ and $D = (x_D, y_D)$ are the centers of these 4 squares such that $y_A \\le y_B \\le y_C \\le y_D$. Note that oval of $B$ is a translation of oval of $A$ with vector $\\vec{AB}$. By lemma 2 these two ovals intersect in at most two points (Note that these ovals are strictly convex because they are intersection of 4 strictly convex shapes). These two points must be $C$ and $D$. Since $A$ is center of symmetry of oval of $A$, by lemma 1, these two intersection points are symmetric with respect to the midpoint of $AB$. Note that $y_B > y_A$, because if $y_A = y_B$, $y_C$ or $y_D$ become less than $y_A = y_B$ contradicts with the minimality of $y_A$.

As intersection of every two rectangles has a unit area, both sides must be unit. \\Box\n\nUsing lemma 3, we get that 3 rectangles are vertical (V) and other 3 are horizontal (H). Consider three horizontal rectangles with their centers sorted by x. Fix the middle one and call it $R_m$. Call left and right rectangles $R_l$ and $R_r$ respectively. Without loss of generality, we can assume that $R_r$ is not upper than $R_l$. As in the figure below $R_m$, $R_r$ intersect in a rectangle with length $\\beta$ and $R_m$, $R_l$ intersect in a rectangle with length $\\alpha$. Left side of $R_r$, right side of $R_l$, top side of $R_l$ and bottom side of $R_m$ construct a rectangle named $R_H$. Width of $R_H$ is $w_H$ and height of it is $h_H$. These variables are based on rectangles in (H), we can define the same variables in (V) named $R_V$, $w_V$ and $h_V$.",

Let *f* be the face of *ABCD* contained in $P_{iX}$. Two vertices of *XYZT* lie on the extensions of perpendiculars from *X* to edges of *f* and so lie on the opposite side of *X*. On the other hand, these vertices create an edge that must be perpendicular to an edge of *ABCD*. This is impossible, however, since they lie on opposite sides, and proves the lemma.\n\nUsing the lemma it can be concluded that *X* is in the smaller region between $P_{1X}$ and $P_{2X}$ and outside *ABCD*. This lemma can be applied to any other vertex, say *Y*, for which the edges connected to it are perpendicular to an open path. It is claimed that there can be at most two such vertices. To prove it, assume to the contrary that there are more than two such vertices. Then using the pigeonhole principle, two vertices, say *X* and *Y*, have a common associated plane, i.e. $P_{iX} = P_{jY}$. So according to the lemma, *X* and *Y* must be on the same side of this plane and apart from *ABCD*. This is impossible, however, because *XY* must intersects an edge of *ABCD*.\n\nIt can be concluded that the third case is possible for at most two vertices of *XYZT*, so the first case is possible for at least two vertices of that tetrahedron. Using the following lemma, the place of these two vertices can be uniquely determined by *ABCD*. Now, perpendicular lines from these two vertices to three edges of *ABCD* determine the lines on which 5 edges of *XYZT* are located, so all of the vertices of *XYZT* are uniquely determined.\n\n\\textbf{Lemma.} \\textit{Consider an equilateral triangle ABC and a point D outside of the plane of ABC such that the angle between mutual perpendicular lines from D to the sides of ABC is 60\\degree.

Using Pythagoras' Theorem for segments $AC'$ and $AB'$ results in\n\n\\[\nAC_1^2 + EC_1^2 = AC_1^2 + C'C_1^2 = AC'^2 = AB'^2 = AB_1^2 + B'B_1^2 = AB_1^2 + EB_1^2.\n\\]\n\nOn the other hand, using the Cosine Theorem for side $AE$ in triangles $AEC_1$ and $AEB_1$ results in\n\n\\[\nAB_1^2 + EB_1^2 - 2AB_1.EB_1 \\cos \\alpha = AC_1^2 + EC_1^2 - 2AC_1.EC_1 \\cos \\alpha.\n\\]\n\nSince $\\cos \\alpha \\neq 0$ ($E \\neq A$), $AC_1.EC_1 = AB_1.EB_1$.

Since $AC' = AB'$ and $AB_1 = AC_1 = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}AC'$, it can be concluded that $CB_1 = BC_1$. Therefore, $B'C = C'B$ which results in $BA' = C'B = B'C = CA'$.

Now, if $(a, b)$ is the output of $y'$, $x'$ will be the state of $X$ after entering $a$ when it is in state $x$.\n\nTo compute $c_n = a_{2n}$, first define a Machine $C$ similar to $B$ for the purpose of multiplication by 2. Then use $C$ instead of $B$ in the definition of $Y$ above to get the desired result. The Machine $C$ is described as follows:\n\n*   **Inputs:** Set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, k-1\\}$.\n*   **States:** A state exists for each pair $(a, b)$ of integers, where $0 \\le a < k$ and $b \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Outputs:** The output of state $(a, b)$ is $(a, b)$ itself.\n*   **Starting State:** $(0, 0)$.\n*   **Transition Function:** When $r$ is entered, the state of the Machine changes from $(a, b)$ to $(a', b')$, where $a'$ and $b'$ are the quotient and remainder of $2r + b$ when divided by $k$, respectively.\n\nc) No! Assume to the contrary that $X$ is a Machine that computes $(a_n)$ in base 3. Let $N$ be the number of states of $X$. Note that for a sufficiently large natural number $m$, the number of $m$-digit perfect square numbers in base 3 is more than $N$. So there are two perfect squares $a$ and $b$ such that after entering digits of these two numbers to $X$ (from right) the same state is reached. Therefore, entering numbers of the form $a + 3^m n$ and $b + 3^m n$ results in the same output. Hence if $(a_n)$ is 3-Computable, then for each natural number $n$, $a + 3^m n$ is a perfect square if and only if $b + 3^m n$ is a perfect square. But this is impossible, because the difference of these numbers is $b - a$ (which is constant), whereas the difference of consecutive perfect square numbers approaches infinity.\n\nd) Suppose that $X$ is a Machine with inputs from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, k-1\\}$. It will be shown that each $k$-Computable sequence is $k$-Left Computable, the converse can be proved similarly. To do this, it suffices to introduce a Machine $Y$ with the same input set as $X$ such that the output of $Y$ after entering digits of a number from left to right equals to the output of $X$ after entering digits of that same number from right to left. Suppose that $\\{s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_m\\}$ is the state set of $X$, $s_1$ its Starting State and $x_i$ the output of state $s_i$. The following Machine will perform the desired operation:\n\n* **Inputs:** Set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, k-1\\}$.\n* **States:** All $m$-tuples $(A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_m)$ of partitions of the set $\\{s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_m\\}$.\n* **Outputs:** The output of state $(A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_m)$ will be $A_i$, where $s_1 \\in A_i$.\n* **Starting State:** $(\\{s_1\\}, \\{s_2\\}, \\dots, \\{s_m\\})$.\n* **Transition Function:** When $r$ is entered, the state of the Machine changes from $(A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_m)$ to $(B_1, B_2, \\dots, B_m)$, where $B_i$ is the set of all those states of $X$ that change to a state in $A_i$ after entering $r$ in $X$.",

In this case, the RHS of the inequality becomes\n\n$$\nRHS = \\frac{a+b+c}{3} - \\frac{3}{\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c}} = \\frac{S+b}{3} - \\frac{3Pb}{Sb+P}.\n$$\n\nThe goal is to minimize the above phrase as a function of $b$; Note that the phrase, as a function of $b$, has a linear term which is $\\frac{S+b}{3}$, and a fractional term with the denominator $Sb + P$. Now we re-write the phrase using the new variable $t = Sb + P$ and with a little calculation we shall have\n\n$$\nRHS = \\frac{S+b}{3} - \\frac{3Pb}{Sb+P} = \\frac{S^2 - 10P}{3S} + \\frac{t}{3S} + \\frac{P^2}{St}.\n$$\n\nNote that the multiply of the last two terms is a phrase without the variable $t$. Therefore with using the AM-GM inequality we obtain\n\n$$\nRHS \\ge \\frac{S^2 - 10P}{3S} + 2\\sqrt{\\frac{P^2}{S^2}} = \\frac{S^2 - 4P}{3S} = \\frac{(c-a)^2}{3(c+a)} \\ge \\frac{(c-a)^2}{6c}. \\blacksquare\n$$\n\nFor the easement of calculations, for any arbitrary formula_1 F(a, b, c) with three variables a, b and c, the cyclic sum\n\n$$\nF(a, b, c) + F(b, c, a) + F(c, a, b),\n$$\n\nis shown with $\\sum F(a, b, c)$. Using this notation, we expand the RHS of the inequality\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\sum a}{3} - \\frac{3}{\\sum \\frac{1}{a}} &= \\frac{\\sum a}{3} - \\frac{3abc}{\\sum ab} = \\frac{(\\sum a)(\\sum ab) - 9abc}{3 \\sum ab} \\\\ &= \\frac{\\sum (a^2b + ab^2) - 6abc}{3 \\sum ab} = \\frac{\\sum a(b-c)^2}{3 \\sum ab}. \\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, the claim of the problem is equivalent to the following inequality\n\n$$\n\\sum a(b-c)^2 \\ge \\left( \\frac{\\sum ab}{2c} \\right) (c-a)^2. \\quad (1)\n$$\nBut note that with condition $a \\le b \\le c$, $\\frac{ab}{2c}$ is not greater than $\\frac{b}{2}$ so for the RHS of the above inequality we have\n\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\sum ab}{2c} \\right) (c-a)^2 = \\left( \\frac{ab}{2c} + \\frac{a+b}{2} \\right) (c-a)^2 \\le \\left( \\frac{a}{2} + b \\right) (c-a)^2. \\quad (2)\n$$\n\nFor the LHS of (1), we have\n\n$$\n\\sum a(b-c)^2 \\ge b(c-a)^2 + a((c-b)^2 + (b-a)^2). \\quad (3)\n$$\n\nNote that for any two numbers $X, Y$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} (X - Y)^2 \\ge 0 &\\implies X^2 + Y^2 - 2XY \\ge 0 \\\\ &\\implies 2(x^2 + Y^2) \\ge (X + Y)^2 \\\\ &\\implies X^2 + Y^2 \\ge \\frac{(X + Y)^2}{2}. \\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, if $X = c - b, Y = b - a$ using (3), we obtain\n\n$$\n\\sum a(b-c)^2 \\ge b(c-a)^2 + a((c-b)^2 + (b-a)^2) \\ge b(c-a)^2 + \\frac{a}{2}(c-a)^2.\n$$\n\nThis inequality along with (2) implies (1) which is equivalent to the claim of the problem. \\textbf{■}"

Adding $-(X+Y)g(Y)$ to that number, implies $X(g(X) - g(Y))$ is divisible by $X+Y$. But $X$ and $X+Y$ are relatively prime, therefore $X+Y \\mid g(X) - g(Y)$.\n\nNow assume that $x'$ is an odd and sufficiently large number that is relatively prime to $x$, in this case according to the lemma\n\n$$\nx + x' \\mid (a - b)(x - x'),\n$$\n\nbut since $\\text{gcd}(x+x', x-x') = 2$ we obtain that $\\frac{x+x'}{2} \\mid (a-b)$. Now choose $x'$ such that it is greater than $2|a-b|$, it implies $a-b=0$ and therefore for large odd numbers $x$ we have $g(x) = 2a-b=a$ and the claim is proved.\n\nNow let $y$ be an arbitrary positive integer, if $x$ is a sufficiently large number, relatively prime with $2y$, according to the lemma\n\n$$\nx + y \\mid g(x) - g(y) = a - g(y).\n$$\n\nSetting $x$ such that it is greater than $|a-g(y)|$, implies $g(y) = a$ and hence $f(y) = ay$.\n\nFinally, using the second assumption we get that the only solutions are $f(x) = ax$ where $a$ is a positive integer not exceeding $\\frac{1395^2}{2}$. $\\blacksquare$",

Now set $g(1) = a$ and $g(2) = b$. We are going to show that for an odd and sufficiently large number $x$, $g(x)$ is equal to $a$. To prove this, we use the first assumption twice, for $y = 1$ and $y = 2$, and an odd number $x$\n\n$$\n\\left.\n\\begin{array}{l}\nx + 1 \\mid xg(x) + a \\\\\nx + 1 \\mid (x + 1)g(x)\n\\end{array}\n\\right\\} \\implies x + 1 \\mid g(x) - a,\n\\\\[2ex]\n\\left.\n\\begin{array}{l}\nx + 2 \\mid xg(x) + 2b \\\\\nx + 2 \\mid (x + 2)g(x)\n\\end{array}\n\\right\\} \\implies x + 2 \\mid 2(g(x) - b) \\implies x + 2 \\mid g(x) - b.\n$$\n\n(The last result is true because $x+2$ is odd.)
